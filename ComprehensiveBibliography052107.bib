First, are the pluralist, structural functionalist, and Marxist literatures of political science societally reductionist, as this movement contends? Second, does the neostatist paradigm remedy these defects and provide a superior analytical model? Third, regardless of the substantive merits of these arguments, are there heuristic benefits flowing from this critique of the literature? Examination of the evidence leads to a rejection of the first two criticisms. The answer to the third question is more complex. There is merit to the argument that administrative and institutional history has been neglected in the political science of the last decades. This is hardly a @'paradigmatic shift@'; and it has been purchased at the exorbitant price of encouraging a generation of graduate students to reject their professional history and to engage in vague conceptualization.},

These different strategic choices, in turn, account for variations in the patterns of external "dependency" that characterize countries in the two regions.},

@article{Pierson1993,
	Abstract = {As governmental activity has expanded, scholars have been increasingly inclined to suggest that the structure of public policies has an important influence on patterns of political change. Yet research on policy feedback is mostly anecdotal, and there has so far been little attempt to develop more general hypotheses about the conditions under which policies produce politics. Drawing on recent research, this article suggests that feedback occurs through two main mechanisms. Policies generate resources and incentives for political actors, and they provide those actors with information and cues that encourage particular interpretations of the political world. These mechanisms operate in a variety of ways, but have significant effects on government elites, interest groups, and mass publics. By investigating how policies influence different actors through these distinctive mechanisms, the article outlines a research agenda for moving from the current focus on illustrative case studies to the investigation of broader propositions about how and when policies are likely to be politically consequential.},

@article{Koelble1992,
	Abstract = {This article juxtaposes the arguments of Przeworski and Sprague, Esping-Andersen, and Dunleavy and Husbands concerning the crisis of social democracy. It suggests that, while Przeworski and Sprague discover important explanations of the electoral problems of social democracy, they overstate the influence of structural variables. Esping-Andersen argues that a party's strategy affects its electoral fortunes and should therefore be treated as an explanatory variable. Dunleavy and Husbands maintain that the British Labour Party's problems are rooted in divergent interests within the working class; they imply that social democracy's electoral decline is caused by both unfavorable structural developments and wrong political choices. The article concludes that, while each author provides important insights, none pays enough attention to the formation of intraparty coalition building which shapes electoral strategies and policy choices.},

	Abstract = {While the economic changes effected by the British Conservative government in the 1980s are transparent, there is considerable debate as to whether there was a political dimension to the "Thatcher Revolution." This paper argues that the Conservatives were successful in undertaking social structural reforms that effectively moved the political center of gravity in Britain to the right and toward the government's preferred market-oriented policy agenda. The government's strategy-manifest in the sale of council houses to tenants and of shares in privatized corporations to individuals, and its attack on organized labor-was narrowly targeted on the swing electorate among wealthier members of the lower socioeconomic strata. The Labour party has acknowledged the successes of the Conservatives' structural reforms, and has moved its policy platform, in Downsian fashion, to the right in order to regain electoral competitiveness.},

	Abstract = {The authors are at present researching the impact of economic recession on class processes in contemporary Britain. The first stage of their study involves a national sample survey of 2000 people between the ages of 16 and 64. This has been linked to an international project on class structure and class consciousness originating from the USA. Many of the results from the British survey will be directly comparable with those obtained for North America, the Scandinavian countries, Australasia, Japan, and (it is hoped) at least three additional states within the Common Market. This paper summarizes the reasoning of the British team in the course of constructing the questionnaire. Although data from the study have yet to be analysed systematically there is some evidence from other sources to suggest that the argument submitted here is sound in essentials.},

	Abstract = {Recent findings show an apparent erosion in the United States over the post-war years of 'social capital' understood as the propensity of individuals to associate together on a regular basis, to trust one another, and to engage in community affairs. This article examines the British case for similar trends, finding no equivalent erosion. It proposes explanations for the resilience of social capital in Britain, rooted in educational reform, the transformation of the class structure, and government policy. It concludes by drawing some general lessons from the British case that stress the importance of the distributive dimensions of social capital and the impact that governments can have on it.},

	Abstract = {The second half of the 1980s was a particularly turbulent time for the British housing market, during which time sizeable real capital gains accrued to owner-occupiers, particularly those who were already owner-occupiers at the start of this period. The paper constructs housing wealth estimates disaggregated by household from the 1985 GHS and 1991 BHPS Wave 1 in order to explain the distributional consequences of the housing market experience. The paper finds that there has been a modest increase in housing wealth inequality, but one that is more pronounced for gross housing wealth compared with equity. This growth has been offset by the growth in owner-occupation and the benefits of the council house right-to-buy scheme.},

@article{1989,
	Abstract = {Privatization is an idea that is popular among political elites throughout the advanced industrial world. In Britain, it has been the centrepiece of Margaret Thatcher's three Conservative governments, reflected in the sale of publicly-owned industries to the private sector and in the sale of council houses to their tenants. Using survey data, this article tests two models to account for privatization policy. The median voter model argues that it was a policy demanded and initiated by voters, while the elite interests model argues that it stemmed from the government and that little popular demand existed for it. The evidence confirms the elite interests model and shows that public opinion has generally accepted the status quo on the public ownership of industry. In addition, the Conservatives have made modest electoral gains from privatization. However, voters are not consistent in their views about privatizating particular industries, implying the Conservatives may lose votes with future privatization.},

	Abstract = {Using panel data and matching techniques, we exploit a rare change in communication flows---the endorsement switch to the Labour Party by several prominent British newspapers before the 1997 United Kingdom general election---to study the persuasive power of the news media. These unusual events provide an opportunity to test for news media persuasion while avoiding methodological pitfalls that have plagued previous studies. By comparing readers of newspapers that switched endorsements to similar individuals who did not read these newspapers, we estimate that these papers persuaded a considerable share of their readers to vote for Labour. Depending on the statistical approach, the point estimates vary from about 10 percent to as high as 25 percent of readers. These findings provide rare, compelling evidence that the news media exert a powerful influence on mass political behavior. },

@article{1999,
	Abstract = {This article uses propensity score methods to estimate the treatment impact of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention earnings. We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables.},

	Abstract = { The term `corporatism' simultaneously designates a particular interest group structure, characterized by monopolistic, centralized and internally non- democratic associations,and a particular policy-making process,also known as `concertation' or `social partnership'. This paper argues that structure and process may no longer be closely associated.By focusing on the Irish and Italian cases, it shows that concertation is perfectly compatible with a non-corporatist structure of the interest representation system. Inter- and intra-organizational co-ordination remains important for the viability of concertation. However, it can be achieved, even in relatively fragmented systems like the Irish and the Italian, through alternative mechanisms relying on democracy and discussion. },

Examples: 1. Move away from NLRB union elections, towards card-check or employer-neutrality elections 2. Engagement with civil society on proxy issues for labor rights: e.g., sweatshops or product safety problems in 3rd world countries that can be tied to the pursuit of cheap labor 3. A return to forms of the "sit-down" strike that keep workers in control of productive capital but demonstrate dissatisfaction 4. Pressure on third parties (e.g., buyers or suppliers of targeted firms) 5. Sector-wide organization, to prevent defection by workers in individual firms Thus the globalization pressures on the main instigator of the welfare state - labor - have not rendered it completely helpless.

	Annote = {Two phases of the European welfare state: 1. 1945-70: expansion, stability, and successs 2. 1970+: retrenchment, instability, and mixed results What changed? 1. The end of "embedded liberalism" as capital and goods controls disappeared, exchange rates floated, and catch-up came to an end. See Ruggie (1982) and Keohane (1984) 2. The entry of new low-cost producers into the global economy 3. The globalization of finance. 4. The shift to a post-industrial / post-Fordist economy, which destabilized the employment structure and lowered productivity growth 5. The shift in family structures that put women in the workforce and removed the "free" source of household services. 6. Aging populations and deteriorating demographics, leading to greater funding pressures on standing welfare states. What were the results: 1. Greater autonomy for firms, leading to less control over national tax bases 2. Greater demands on the welfare state for protection against new risks - demands the welfare state (particularly in central and southern Europe) wasn't well-prepared to deal with 3. Greater budgetary constraints for the welfare state (both due to the deteriorating tax base and the greater international financial constraint) What were the responses: 1. Structural adjustment: a move to PAYGO systems and adjustment of incentives for greater efficiency 2. Active, not passive, unemployment policy (job retraining, benefits incentives to take work, etc) 3. Retargeting of resources to those most in need (means testing) 4. Restructuring financing to insulate it from demographic pressures How has this been analyzed: 1. "Recalibration": functional (risk balancing), distributive (in favor of protection of the most vulnerable), discursive (in terms of norms and ways of discussing the purpose of the WS) and politico-institutional (modes and levels of engagement on politics of welfare state adjustment. 2. Power Resources and Pierson: why, when conservatives were in power in most places, did welfare state retrenchment not go further? Pierson's answer: because the welfare state had developed far-flung constituencies much different from those that were instrumental in its founding as described by PR. },

	Annote = {Observes two extremes: 1. Globalization will ruin the tax state (general theories of 1980s/90s globalization, + the Washington Consensus) 2. Globalization does not threaten the tax state at all (countries still retain policymaking autonomy and the size of welfare states doesn't matter to growth or employment) Genschel rejects both. Several changes: 1. Increased sanctions against tax evasion and avoidance 2. Increased (though still meager) international coordination on taxation; but tends towards lowest-common-denominator coordination and has been consistently rejected even in coordinated polities like the EU 3. Transnationalization of hte tax base: greater disputes with multinational corporations about where revenues actually come from and how they are attributed. Problems for the state: 1. Erosion of the corporate tax base amidst internationalization of firms 2. Equity-efficiency problems: lower corporate tax rates may keep jobs at home; but the existence of parallel income tax regimes for labor and capital is difficult to justify politically 3. Maintenance of overall revenue levels becomes difficult. Efforts: 1. Reduce corporate taxes but broaden the tax base (revenue-neutral) 2. Treat corporate and individual income taxes (and capital and labor taxes) as separate issues. 3. OR - reduce income taxes across the board, in order to maintain the equity of the tax system. },

	Annote = {Findings on how globalization affects taxation: 1. Capital mobility and international openness are correlated with lower statutory rates of taxation but not lower effective rates 2. Capital mobility is negatively correlated with the tax component of labor costs (higher labor taxes impinging on the firm) Conclusion: 1. What has changed: the use of tax policy as a redistributive instrument emphasizing high marginal rates in a steeply progressive system; Statutory capital taxation levels. 2. What has not changed: the overall tax level and the distribution of tax burden between labor and capital. Thus it seems that policymakers are caught between two problems: first, the problem of taxing capital in a capital-mobile environment, and second, the problem of mass unemployment and the need to reduce it. See Genschel (2005) for a similar argument. Competing problems: rising structural unemployement; equity concerns; mobile capital; greater economic uncertainty owing to increased international trade flows. },

	Annote = {Argument: there's little evidence that globalization has significantly constrained the size of the state or its ability to engage in autonomous economic policymaking. What has occurred, however, is a divergence in the policy preferences of the OECD states. States have confronted globalization both by stripping down or radically reforming their tax/social policy to become more business-friendly, and by reconfiguring their welfare states to better buffer their economies and citizens against the instabilities of global economic exposure. There's little evidence to suggest that one or the other has produced dramatically different growth features. This is true in the following dimensions: 1. Size of the state (\% of GDP) 2. Income transfers 3. Deficits 4. Taxation rates Indeed, politics still seems to matter. States with longer traditions of left-center government (or greater left-center success) show different policies than other states (divergence), but not dramatically different levels of growth. Note, however, one limitation: welfare states do face constraints insofar as aging populations + deteriorating macroeconomic performance coincide; there are new limits to the level of taxation that will be tolerated, even if those limits are higher than we supposed. },

@article{majone1999rsa,
	Abstract = {While the interventionist state was characterised by a high level of centralisation in administration and policy making, the regulatory state relies on extensive delegation of powers to independent institutions: regulatory agencies or commissions, but also the judiciary which is becoming an increasingly active player in the regulatory game. Delegation of important policy-making powers to non-majoritarian institutions raises novel problems of democratic legitimacy. This article argues that such problems should be tackled not by limiting the independence of the regulators, but rather by strengthening the accountability structure. Similar problems arise at the European level. Here, too, the correct solution is a better accountability structure rather than increased politicisation. The de- politicisation of European policy making is a consequence of the fact that the large majority of Europe's voters support far-reaching economic integration but oppose true political integration. },
	Annote = {Argument: that the "legitimacy problem" of the European institutions derives from their status (by and large) as administrative bodies with powers delegated from the member states but insufficiently supported by disclosure and transparency rules. This is a problem at the MS and EU level, and thus can only be fixed if both national and EU bodies move towards greater transparency. Four arguments about the "democratic deficit" 1. Parliamentarism by analogy: the EU lacks legitimacy because the EP lacks full parliamentary sovereignty 2. Parliamentarism by comparison: the EU lacks legitimacy because the EP lacks powers similar to MS parliaments 3. Social democracy - the EU provides insufficient SD to go along with its open markets, and thus lacks legitimacy in the eyes of an SD populace 4. The shift to the EP under Maastricht weakened the Council but did little to strengthen the Parliament; thus both national and majoritarian forces are now weaker. Majone believes that 1\&2 are wrong insofar as full parliamentary sovereignty is impossible at the EU level for lack of MS will and in general for lack of skill (no MS parliament is the sole arbiter of regulation). 3 is wrong since EU member state citizens usually reject common social policy, and due to the technical problems of doing so. Two kinds of "democratic deficit": 1. The plebiscitary one - insufficient popular input to the EU via voting, and insufficient EU-level majoritarian democracy 2. The administrative one - insufficient transparency and accountability of those institutions that wield the delegated powers The first really can't be solved, in Majone's view, so long as the citizens of the EU member states continue to desire economic integration without political integration. The cleavages of the EU - language, culture, ideology, economic development, and size - make the unanimity rules at the EU level necessary. And the separation of economics from politics requires taking the politics out of economic decision-making. Hence the default to adminstrative rather than deliberative decision-making. The second can be solved, but must be solved at the EU level and at the national level. Most EU MS have a history of opaque administrative bodies; their preferences became EU preferences during the establishment of the European institutions. This does not have to remain this way.},

	Annote = {Argument: that on major issues of social policy within the realm of the welfare state, the EU / EC has not and probably will not make substantial additional progress. It is both difficult - owing to national government prerogatives for spending and redistribution internally - and inadvisable - owing to the problems of regional redistribution and the tremendous barrier to giving Brussels an actual budget. Note, however, that this does not preclude social progress in other areas. Environmental, health, and safety protections have developed quickly under the SEA; additional progress was expected under Maastricht. The advisability of common standards for a common market in this regard is useful. Goods are more tradeable than people - the language barriers remain - and so in a common market, regulatory arbitrage is of concern. },

The more successful social pact states appear to have a larger portion of wages as cash compensation, meaning that the ability of the union moderation to affect job creation is strong; benefits are provided on the basis of some general taxation, rather than point taxation.

First, there are economies of scale in the R\&D function, and if they are strong enough R\&D will be concentrated in a single centre. Second, there are locational economies of integration and agglomeration in innovation. In new product development a close interaction is normally required between research and production facilities and users, while if several firms are engaged in the development of related new products (or processes) geographical proximity will encourage a greater volume of beneficial spillovers between them. Third, the original product cycle model viewed innovation as a demand-led process (see Schmookler, 1966, for another contemporary account), and thus for US MNCs innovation would be located in the more conducive environment of their home country, stimulated by the particular characteristics of the demand of high income consumers and skill-intensive downstream production facilities. },

Here, Joppke modifies this in two ways: -The judiciary is generally shielded from the ebb and flow of public opinion, and thus may not respond even when legislators do -In the European case, this is complicated by perceived moral obligations towards certain groups (based on the legacy of empire) that create patchwork laws Thus: the ECJ has often ruled against member-state rules for restricting immigration (see Britain in 1979-80, on laws that were designed to prevent primary male immigration by restricting family unity); and in Germany, the status of German-descendent immigrants was treated much differently from non-Germans as a consequence of the dismemberment of Germany through the 20th century; see, however, late-1980s reforms under the terms of German ideas of accounting for past sins, even under Conservative governments (Genscher and the FDP)},

	Abstract = {A number of scholars have highlighted the role of employers in shaping the development of the welfare state. Yet the results of this research have often been ambiguous or disputed because of insufficient attention to theoretical, conceptual, and methodological problems in the study of political influence. This article considers three of these problems in turn: the failure to distinguish and investigate multiple mechanisms of exercising influence, the misspecification of preferences, and the inference of influence from ex post correlation between actor preferences and outcomes. We demonstrate the importance of each through a reexamination of the early development of the American welfare state. The striking feature we suggest is neither business dominance nor weakness but marked variation in influence over time and across institutional settings.},

	Abstract = {Highly corporatist countries such as Denmark and Sweden have recently moved away from centralized wage bargaining. A general sectoral coalition model explains the decentralization of wage bargaining as the outcome of a cross-class realignment between employers and wage earners in response to changes in the political, economic, and technological environment of wage bargaining. This realignment is aimed at increasing wage flexibility while containing cost pressures and is associated with greater inequality and the reorientation of macroeconomic policies away from full employment. A contrast of Denmark and Sweden with Austria and Norway, where wage bargaining institutions have not been changed, supports the argument.},

Clearly, the political economies of today are not those of the 1950s; they have much different patterns of industrial relations, welfare provision, etc (even as they exist within a given type). So what to say? Likewise, some historical junctures would seem to produce the kind of opportunity for institutional change envisioned by the "transformation" aspect of historical institutionalism, but do not. For instance, how to explain the discontinuity in 1992 in Italy, only to see the perpetuation of significant electoral and political instability? Thus we need to not only explain change, but the absence of change despite promising circumstances. What are institutions: formalized rules that can be enforced by a third party. But not just contracts or other voluntary associations: rather, the institutions of interest are expressions of power, authority, obligation (and thus coercion) and enforcement. Five modes of change: Displacement New models emerge (for example, through cognitive or normative evolution) that gradually displace old models as diffusion suggests their obsolescence.

Those settlements were conditioned by government intervention, degree of worker organization, and firm prerogative. Those states that had no traditional artisanate (the US) or had destroyed it (the UK) did not found craft or skill training programs, and evolved into general skill economies. Those that had strong artisanal traditions (Germany and Japan) that were coupled to strong status indicators founded institutions that replicated these status levels and skill development programs, and evolved into specific skill economies. In general skill economies, the key tension was between workers and firms over the question of job creation and wage levels, leading to a high tendency towards defection (workers) and an unwillingness to support skill development (firms). In the latter case, the tension was between skilled artisans and industrial workers over pay and status, and developed in ways that encouraged skill formation and firm support of specific skill institutions. },

	Annote = {1980+ and economic adjustment: 1982, the Social Democratic Danish government resigns over failure to manage the economy well. A liberal / non-social-democratic government takes over and dominates elective office for a decade. Repositioning the Social Democratic party in this light requires repositioning against both the Liberals and Social Liberals. Doing so is best accomplished via working for protection of pensions over other social rights. Thus the "Third Way" is best seen as a political (as well as a political economy) solution to a problem of elective office. Having failed on earlier comprehensive social democracy, the Danish Social Democrats repositioned the party to protect what they and their constituents saw as the most important part of social democracy. Hence the end of major labor market protections alongside the iprovement of active labor market policy. This raises several challenges to social democracy (here, contra Kitschelt (1994)). 1. How appealing is the Third Way in reality? Does it open up opportunities for other parties (particularly, as in the NL, far-right parties) to oppose welfare or push welfare reform on the basis of immigration? 2. Effective economic governance in parallel with welfare state protection put the Social Democrats in a vulnerable position. Moving to favor one or the other risks a constitutency. },

	Abstract = {Far right parties have gained dramatically in many West European countries since the early 1980s. Recent cross-national studies distinguish between neo-fascist parties, which are antidemocratic and anticapitalist, and radical right-wing parties, which combine opposition to immigration with procapitalist, neoliberal economic positions, social conservatism, and basic acceptance of representative democracy. Yet in some borderline cases it is difficult to determine whether parties reject fascism and accept democracy, a problem the theoretical literature has neglected. The far right's success is due largely to the politicization of immigration issues, political alienation, and backlashes against welfare states.},
	Annote = {General reasons identified in the literature for far-right resurgence: 1. Convergence among mainstream political parties 2. Economic dislocation and stagnation 3. Rising immigration 4. Far-right party families (there's always been these parties, and these are just the new versions thereof) 5. Action-reaction: left-libertarianism-postmodernism sparks right-neoliberalism-conservativism. See Kitschelt's framework in "Transformation" Kitschelt's 3-part typology: -New radical right: neoliberal on economics, socially conservative, xenophobic (e.g., the FN, Danish Progress Party) -Populist antistatist: neoliberal on economics, not particularly xenophobic, and in opposition to new-left-postmaterialism (e.g. Lega Nord, FPO) -Welfare chauvinist: anti-neoliberal on economics, xenophobic, nationalist, and conservative (e.g. Die Republikaner) NOTE - different compromise positions on the EU. The FN supports the EU as a "a Europe of Nations" in line with de Gaulle. But so too do Die Republikaner. Lega Nord does not support the EU or Rome. NOTE - Welfare Chauvinist parties like Die Republikaner can't adopt neoliberal positions because that tracks too close to the neofascist remnants of society, which then attracts those remnants to the party and makes it either unsavory or illegal (as in Germany). NOTE - exception to the is Vlaams Blok, which makes explicit appeals to neo-fascist elements. Why then successful? Three reasons: longer and deeper economic crisis than in most WE countries; linguistic divisions render politics more divisive; and constitutional reforms granted greater resources to the Flemish nationalists, of whom the Vlaams Blok is composed. NOTE - little support for the "far right parties family" argument, for reasons noted above: neo-fascist appeals tend to lose elections, with the exception of Vlaams Blok. },

@article{Zysman1977,
	Abstract = {The French state bureaucracy, able partially to shelter itself from Parliament and to influence the industrial sector directly, has been able to protect national interests in an economically interdependent world. It struck a regional bargain that committed agriculture to the European Community and in effect provided a German subsidy to French farmers. It mediated between the national and international market to promote industrial modernization and force a restructuring of critical industrial sectors. It has grown increasingly sophisticated in its dealings with multinational companies. Early efforts to insist on purely French operations have been abandoned, permitting the state to negotiate more effectively with the multinationals and obtain substantive rather than symbolic goods. These policies have cushioned agriculture's transition into an industrial world and helped pressure a previously protected industry to modernize. Finally, the state has played trader, trying directly to market French goods and assure payment for imports in package trade deals. The French have not been able to impose their own rules on monetary and energy matters. Yet their efforts suggest that a nation-state can use administrative or domestic economic resources to reduce its vulnerability to international developments, thought it cannot of course escape from the system.},

	Abstract = {This article tests political explanations of policy adjustment to macroeconomic imbalances against the Italian experience since the late 1970s. After describing Italian governments' attempts to implement macroeconomic policy adjustment, I evaluate four possible causes of policy changes: political instability, a `tying hands' strategy of entangling the state in international commitments, analysis of the aggregate costs of pursuing macroeconomic policies that diverge from the policies of other important states, and the preferences of domestic groups. I evaluate the utility of each explanation according to its ability to answer two empirical questions: Why was adjustment delayed in Italy until about 1988? And why has the form of macroeconomic policy adjustment -- monetary or fiscal -- changed over time? The evidence indicates that answering these questions requires specifying how the costs of various macroeconomic policy mixes fall on domestic groups, and then determining which of these groups have the most political influence. },

@article{streeck2005era,
	Abstract = { The twin predicaments of German labour market performance and welfare state performance triggered an ongoing debate on reforming the German model. Recently, this debate has yielded an outcome in the form of the so-called Hartz laws, a bundle of labour market policies aimed at the reduction of unemployment and the decrease of non- wage labour costs. The Hartz reforms have played a prominent role in the public discussion, but are they really a watershed as both optimists and pessimists claim? In this article we investigate in what sense the Hartz reforms mark a substantive political change and how they are related to similar processes in other countries. To characterise the policy output we discuss three views of policy reform: reform as a process of policy- learning, reform as a process of competitive realignment and reform as a process of reinforcing path dependence. We show which of the three paradigms accounts for which part of the political result. We find evidence for both policy diffusion and retrenchment, but it is too early to speak of a change of regime. Rather, both the changes thus far and the blocked proposals follow a traditional German logic of strong institutional resistance. },

@article{1978,
	Abstract = {The international system is not only an expression of domestic structures, but a cause of them. Two schools of analysis exploring the impact of the international system upon domestic politics (regime types, institutions, coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which stress the international economy, and those which stress political-military rivalry, or war. Among the former are such arguments as: late industrialization (associated with Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments (Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American writing in the 50s and 60s); transnational relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane, Morse); neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists (Schurmann). Arguments stressing the role of war include those which focus on the organizational requirements of providing security (Hintze, Anderson), the special nature of foreign relations (classical political theory), territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains of foreign involvement (analysis of revolutions). These arguments provide the basis for criticism of much of the literature which uses domestic structure as an explanation of foreign policy, in particular those which (such as the strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by excessive focus on forms, to obscure the connection between structures and interests, and the role of politics. These arguments also permit criticism of the notion of a recent fundamental discontinuity in the nature of international relations.},

@article{1998,
	Abstract = {The introduction of the euro is accompanied by an independent European Central Bank (ECB) which is solely responsible for monetary policy in the euro zone. No European institution will be introduced to flank the ECB. This particular institutional design is problematic. This article argues that Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) suffers moderately from a democratic deficit. However, the case of Germany illustrates that it is not the independence of the ECB that should be cause for concern, but the absence of specific domestic features and a government. It is unclear which political authority will be held responsible if EMU leads to an uneven distribution of costs and benefits across the euro zone. Economic literature suggests that under EMU distortions could well occur and that a different design could deal better with these imperfections. The historical process leading to EMU explains the reasons for its particular design. Although imperfect, EMU is an improvement over the pre-EMU status quo in which Germany de facto dominated monetary policy. Nevertheless, the design of EMU remains suboptimal.},

Judged against existing advanced industrial democracies, rather than an ideal plebiscitary or parliamentary democracy, the EU is legitimate. Its institutions are tightly constrained by constitu- tional checks and balances: narrow mandates, fiscal limits, super-majoritarian and concurrent voting requirements and separation of powers. The EU's appearance of exceptional insulation reflects the subset of functions it performs -- central banking, constitutional adjudication, civil prosecution, economic diplomacy and technical administration. These are matters of low electoral salience commonly delegated in national systems, for normatively justifiable reasons. On balance, the EU redresses rather than creates biases in political representation, deliberation and output. },

@article{Majone:1998,
	Abstract = {Arguments about Europe's democratic deficit are really arguments about the nature and ultimate goals of the integration process. Those who assume that economic integration must lead to political integration tend to apply to European institutions standards of legitimacy derived from the theory and practice of parliamentary democracies. We argue that such standards are largely irrelevant at present. As long as the majority of voters and their elected representatives oppose the idea of a European federation, while supporting far-reaching economic integration, we cannot expect parliamentary democracy to flourish in the Union. Economic integration without political integration is possible only if politics and economics are kept as separate as possible. The depoliticisation of European policy-making is the price we pay in order to preserve national sovereignty largely intact. These being the preferences of the voters, we conclude that Europe's `democratic deficit' is democratically justified. The expression `democratic deficit,' however, is also used to refer to the legitimacy problems of non-majoritarian institutions, and this second meaning is much more relevant to a system of limited competences such as the EC. Now the key issues for democratic theory are about the tasks which may be legitimately delegated to institutions insulated from the political process, and how to design such institutions so as to make independence and accountability complementary and mutually supporting, rather than antithetical. If one accepts the `regulatory model' of the EC, then, as long as the tasks delegated to the European level are precisely and narrowly defined, non- majoritarian standards of legitimacy should be sufficient to justify the delegation of the necessary powers. },

@article{Berman1997,
	Abstract = {A new body of literature challenges theoretical approaches to the study of party development and electoral change. Politics in the advanced industrial nations seemed to undergo a fundamental transformation in the 1970s. Left parties confronted particularly severe problems, and scholars looked for answers in broad structural variables that shaped parties' environments. The most widely accepted explanation, put forth by Ronald Inglehart, argued that postmaterialist values increasingly reshaped western politics. The new literature challenges the significance of the value shift and treats parties as independent variables, as active shapers of their fate.},
	Annote = {Three insights (from Berman 1997 review): (1) Parties' shifting fortunes are connected to their history and appeal, not to broad structural trends in external environments (2) Organizational structures, ideological traditions, and leaders help shape parties' responses to challenges (3) In a competitive political system 'alternative' political organizations will either solidify into traditional forms or pass from the scene. In other words: parties adapt in much the way we would expect institutions to adapt. They see problems within a framework of past decisions, history, and institutional competencies. Their ability to adapt to a changing institutional context - in this case, changing salience of issues in their electorate - is based on how these factors influence their ability to adopt new policies as their own. Parties with highly defined bases, that have been very successful in the past catering to those bases, may not be as flexible as those that have moved in and out of power, or been out of power for awhile (see the Tories, 1974; the PS, 1972-1983; the Democrats, 1992; Labour, 1997). But this also applies to the emergent parties. Parties still serve broader roles dictated by the elctoral system in which they act. To fill those roles, alternative parties can't remain alternative for long. Hence the same factors influence new party survival as influence old party adaptation. Examples: Note the example of the Greens: from being a single-issue or narrow-issue party (environmentalism and anti-nuclear policy) to a party embracing a wider set of economic goals and eventually, in 1997-1999, moving to send troops to the Balkans. Contrast that with other parties that were less ideologically flexible and thus either faded away or were absorbed into the mainstream parties. See also Mitterand and the U-turn, a radical redirection of a major political party that depended largely on the ability of the its leader. See the SPD (a specifically working class party) that was vulnerable to the emergence of the Greens on the Left because of inflexibility in its ideological principles and electoral base.},

@article{1998,
	Abstract = {Far right parties have gained dramatically in many West European countries since the early 1980s. Recent cross-national studies distinguish between neo-fascist parties, which are antidemocratic and anticapitalist, and radical right-wing parties, which combine opposition to immigration with procapitalist, neoliberal economic positions, social conservatism, and basic acceptance of representative democracy. Yet in some borderline cases it is difficult to determine whether parties reject fascism and accept democracy, a problem the theoretical literature has neglected. The far right's success is due largely to the politicization of immigration issues, political alienation, and backlashes against welfare states.},

	Annote = {General: that TH Marshall's view of the welfare state as derived from evolving ideas about social citizenship, while useful, ignores the role that redistribution plays in dealing with the development and maintenance of families. Historical evidence clearly shows that this question was in the minds of those arguing over the welfare state - whether children and wives were a social good that society should support, or a private choice that was thus left to the individual. Moreover, this formulation usually treated women as dependents in law as well as fact, a situation that has persisted with some ill effects, particularly in Christian Democratic states. Thus the need to reconsider welfare policy in light of debates on family. Like Esping-Andersen, three areas of redistributive policy: the welfare state, the labor market, and family policy. France and Britain provide the cases: Britain as a case in which family distribution was based heavily on the male breadwinner model, and was meager in benefits; France as a case of social citizenship with rich benefits. Why the difference? Pedersen argues that the answer lies in two debates: the political debate over the structure of benefits, and the economic considerations of various policy options. The political rhetoric was key. In Britain, the rhetoric was dominated by those who either wanted to protect existing benefits or guard against the gender redistribution aims of feminists (the civil service and the trade unions, respectively). In France, the shaping of debate as one over patriotic duty to restore the population after WWI won the day. The economic argument: that the move towards family-level distribution reflects the relative strength of the British TUC and the French capital owners. The TUC resisted family distribution out of concern that it would restrain the growth of men's wages; the French capital owners supported it on the same grounds. That both won suggests the relative power of labor in Britain versus France.},

	Annote = {GENERAL: questionable estimation strategy. Why do we expect these things to be linear? What tests were done to determine if the data was poolable across either country or year? Tests for multicolinearity (and thus artificial inflation of the coefficients) were done, and some more egregious correlations eliminated. Pooling by country gives the time-series results; pooling by time period gives the x-sectional results. A few other problems: 1. If there's a time trend in the data (as there almost certainly is in, say, the GDPPC numbers), then the GLS methods are incapable of dealing with them. GLS assumes an error structure of the covariates in the time-series results that is the same for all time (e.g., in each time period, the error structure is the same). But if there is any autocorrelation behavior taking place, this is non-sensical, because the errors will be different at different points in time. The authors do make some attempts to deal with the non-standard errors, but make no explanation for why the 1a. Unless you believe that the unit root processes that could be taking place in both are equivalent (common unit root), then the errors will still be wrong (probably too large). 2. Why isn't GDPPC corrected for real figures? Why is CPI treated differently? CPI shouldn't matter to the relative measure of the welfare state size (since, to a first approximation, the ratio of SS/GDP has the CPI in both numerator and denominator); unless you have some reason to believe that the inflators for the two figures are different, and even then this doesn't help you. Including CPI in this fashion doesn't take care of the inflation process buried in the GDPPC number, either. It would if they were using logs, but they aren't. 3. Reasoning is weird. They get a negative correlation between strike rate and social spending and argue, among other things, that it is "incorrectly signed." What's that supposed to mean? That it doesn't fit the priors? What they conclude: 1. Christian democracy is better correlated with welfare state founding than social democracy 2. Social democracy is better correlated with welfare state expansion that CD 3. Odd conclusion: "It is less rising affluence over time than it is being in the club of richer countries." Doesn't "rising affluence over time" put you in the club of rich countries eventually?},

	Annote = {Question: how can institutionalism account for both continuity and change? Answer: institutionalism is not fundamentally about how a set of rules per se persist, but about how those persistant rules shape the way that policy inputs are translated into outputs. Thus a changing set of demands from the input side can still cause changed outputs without the institutions, properly understood, changing. Cases: Why do some nations have national healthcare systems and others do not? In Switzerland, France, and Sweden, national systems were proposed. The Swiss rejected it wholesale, the French settled for a mixed system of public insurance and private doctors, and the Swedes for a fully nationalized system. How to explain this institutional variance? By looking at the institutions that existed when thesse policies were proposed, and how they translated the responses of various social actors into policy. Immergut argues that the distance between the three policy proposals was minimal, but the outcomes widely different. The difference appears to hinge on the political institutions of the three countries. Rejected explanations: 1. Doctors' opposition: in each country, the doctors opposed it. Why did they get their way in Switz. but not in Sweden? Why weren't Swedish doctors, in shorter supply than their Swiss counterparts, even stronger than the Swiss? 2. Union preferences. Swedish unions were stronger, numbers-wise, than French; but the Swiss were also stronger than the French 3. Political partisanship - while the Swedes do have stronger socialist parties (and the other countries line up appropriately), that strength doesn't correlate well with preference on this particular issue. 4. Role of the bureaucracy: but the bureaucracy remains relatively fixed even as policy changes. Moreover, these structures (such as Swiss federalism) don't appear to have played a role in dictating political outcomes. Instead: The structure and location of veto points shaped how social actors took preferences, conceived outside the institutional structure, and put them into practice. This is contra other theories of institutionalism (from Hall, Weir, and others) that suggest that institutions constrain policy preferences ahead of implementation. Rather, in each case the social actors' preferences had much in common (among doctors vs. among labor) but three different outcomes resulted, consequence of the different institutional conditions under which they operated.},

	Annote = {INTRODUCTION: 1. The welfare state is a risk-sharing mechanism more than a redistributive mechanism 2. Social risks were insured based on some agreed-upon degree of social fairness across classes 3. How do we explain the differences in social solidarity, and its causal role in determining the extent of social insurance, across countries? Clearly some are different than others - Scandinavia vs. Britain, Germany vs. France, etc. At root, this is a question of how the societies in question arrived at an agreement on risk-sharing. 4. The evolution in different social groups' abilities to manage risk internally account for some of the reasons for welfare state variability and evolution over time. 5. The existence of hte social insurance system itself changes the conditions under which groups perceive and attempt to alter their abilitties to manage social risk But how to explain solidarity? Two possiblilities, both insufficient: 1. Economics - solidarity as self-interest in another guise, on the basis that for some things, you can only get goods through cooperation. But if that is true, why is their social conflict over certain kinds of solidarity (e.g., redistributive pension schemes?) 2. Altruism - solidarity as a natural human trait; but why then is it only active under certain conditions? Two more possibilites, better but still lacking: 1. "Laborist" approach - the solidaristic social welfare state is the result of certain groups attaining political power; the extent of the solidaristic state is a function of how significant and durable that power was. (But if true, how to explain welfare states emergent from other situations?) 2. The "common experiences" approach - that groups that had traditionally not been very interested in helping each other were, through common experiences like WWII, brought together in post-experience attempts to create a more just society. (But if true, then do welfare states only emerge out of catastrophic events that reshape social relations?) Interpretations for WS Origins: 1. Bonapartist: Politically functional: how do welfare states help to preserve the status quo? Quasi-Marxist, insofar as it argues that the WS runs counter to the long-term interests of the working class. But the question remains, why: either WS concessions were unavoidable concessions to the needy to avoid revolution; or the elites that did not undertake them failed to recognize clear self-interest. Why? 2. Social: Similar to a power-resources argument about the ability of the working class to accomplish class interests via the pursuit and attainment of political power. But - how then to account for the significant role played by corporatist groups (representing non-working class interests), Catholic parties (typically more bourgeois), and other non-working-class actors who contributed to the formation of the welfare state? 3. State arguments Note that both earlier arguments assume direct translation of intentions of "founding elements" into law and practice. But the state - as an administrative body with a role to play in putting law into practice - is a separate actor here. Thus interests may not be translated 1:1 into outcomes. But - Baldwin notes that this replaces one ambiguity (which social actor is most important) for another (how independent is the state from the social actors?). The role of the state is important - but it is also constrained by the positions of the social actors, particularly in democratic or quasi-democratic societies. Baldwin's interest: Those debates over the universal benefits (pensions, health insurance) rather than benefits targeted at specific groups. How does the ultimate extent of universality (how universal is universal) express the solidarity of a society? CONCLUSION: 1. The laborist interpretation fails - because the interests in social solidarity evolve over time. While the bourgeois was more self-reliant in the immediate postwar period, economic changes by the 1970s had changed its relations to the state, in ways that made it more interested in the solidaristic benefits that the welfare state could offer. 2. The existence of the welfare state itself changed the environment in which people assessed their interests. It became reasonable to consider entering a broader risk pool once that risk pool already existed; thus there is an element of historical institutionalism to the welfare state, in the sense that it changes the cost-benefit calculatoin of groups outside of it, possibly leading to expansions in the terms of solidarity. 3. Solidarity only emerges, in the risk-sharing sense, when different groups in society see themselves subject to the same risks. Tracking how that evolution of risk exposure takes place gives insight into how the social groups are created that sponsor and sustain the welfare state. 4. },

	Annote = {Power-resources approach to the origins of the welfare state: the boundaries of the state were shaped by a multitude of factors, important among them the character of the power distribution among social actors. Important variables: the degree of unionization; the degree of working-class political organization (these two most important for the authors); budgetary constraints; ownership of capital; labor power and the number of wage earners vs. other forms of income dependency. This approach is contra the approach of the analysts who look only at quantitative variables of the welfare state - notably size of WS budgets. This doesn't necessarily explain what the state really does, or why it does it. Large pension policies in the absence of other WS programs suggest a particular type of politics. Assessment of PR for the three cases: Sweden as the strongest case, a function of the very strong LO labor union, its close association to the social democratic party (SAP), and the unionization of salaried employees under the TCO. Austria as the middle case: The strength of the labor unions and their ties to party approximate those of Sweden, but are weakened by internal religious and political cleavages that dilute their power to act as a unified body, a problem that does not exist for the bourgeois under the OVP. Germany as the weakest: the labor unions have a relatively small share of the wage-earning population; salaried workers are not unionized; and the ties to the SPD, while strong, have not propelled the SPD into power (SPD in opposition from 1945-1966). Purpose of the WS: De-commodification: the creation of circumstances under which a reasonable standard of living can be enjoyed by families regardless of marketplace success; the divorcing of social existence from market performance. "Social democratic" WS as those that most fully satisfy this criteria - the WS as an integral part of politics; vs. the "bourgeois" state, in which the WS is marginal to politics and supplies a correspondingly more marginal set of benefits. Politics of the WS: -Labor/left have sought social democratic institutions that aggregate the largest portion of the populace as possible into common welfare state institutions, cutting across class lines, in order to institutionalize the distribution of resources and promote social solidarity. -Bourgeois parties have sought WS institutions that are more minimal and, where possible, preserve the existing set of social status separations (e.g., Germany, male breadwinner-centric welfare state and benefits proportional to wages). How the cases fit: -Germany, very strong bourgeois (esp. Catholic/Christian-democratic), and a weak pre-war labor movement, lead to a bourgeois welfare state. -Scandinavia, weaker bourgeois and stronger labor movement, lead to a social-democratic welfare state. Sweden: The dual presence of urban workers' parties and farmers' parties made a red-green coalition possible starting in the late 19th century, and weakened the bourgeois by denying it an ally in the working class. The structure of the welfare state was consciously designed to be as inclusive as possible, so to induce social solidarity. Postwar reform and extension continued this process. The 1959 pension reform pushed social policy into the domain of housing, crowding out the private housing market. Problems emerged with the 1970s and the conflict between the guaranteed wage policies and the mandate for full employment and high productivity. The Lib/Cons governments of 1978-1982 have attempted to push back on these policies, via welfare state retrenchment policies, but made little headway prior to the return of hte social democrats. Austria: An explicitly corporatist strategy in place before 1914 prevented the emergence of working class solidarity. -Early WS policy was adminsitered by Conservative governments; but as of 1900, this had largely failed to prevent the emergence of social democratic / socialist parties, and so was abandoned as a strategy. -Social competition in the 1920s drew on the older corporatist patterns: liberal and conservative parties made sure that benefits were structured and packaged to deal with particular social groups, rather than cross-class groups. This pattern continued after 1945, until the election of an SPO (social-democratic) government in 1970, at which point efforts were made at social welfare reform to decrease the degree of regressivity. -Nevertheless, the structure of the welfare state remains generous but highly stratified. Austria has achieved this balance with a set of social programs that deliver, but in a market that tolerates higher degrees of income inequality than other states. Germany: -Postwar, unions were weak except in specific sectors; the DGB did not include salaried or farm employees. The CDU/CSU party brings together both bourgeois and traditional farmers, leaving the SPD with a smaller base in the urban working class. -The result: a set of welfare policies linked both to market performance (via indexing to past wages) and to existing class and social structures (by differentiating between working class and salaried groups, emphasizing the male breadwinner model of social provision, and mandating worker contributions) -Even under the SPD government of Brandt, major chagnes to the welfare state favored by the SPD proved difficult. Conclusions: 1. Boundaries of social citizenship vary across countries 2. The extent and nature of those boundaries appears to vary with the strength of the working class political movement 3. Thus the power-resources model has a good deal to say about how the welfare state developed in the postwar era, and why transnational variation remains today.},

	Abstract = {Class voting is supposedly in severe decline in advanced industrial democracies. However, this conventional wisdom derives from research using prob- lematic methods and measures and an overly simple model of political change. This chapter overviews past and current comparative research into changes in and expla- nations of class-based political behavior and argues for the continued significance of class voting and, by extension, class politics in contemporary democracies. I partic- ularly emphasize the importance of using more appropriate methods and the appli- cation and testing of theories that integrate developments in this area with those in studies of voting behavior more generally. This translates into a need for the sys- tematic testing of bottom-up/top-down interactions in the relations between social structure and political preferences and the precise specification and measurement of explanatory mechanisms that can account for the association between class position and voting. },
	Annote = {Argument from method: argues that evidence presented for the decline of class salience to electoral politics may suffer from the same problems that have always plagued the measures of class voting; that the results of these studies are thus suspect; and that the jury is still out on whether claims from Inglehart (1986) on post-materialism or other causes of the decline in class salience are well-founded. Common explanations for decline: 1. Social class has lost some or all of its importance as a determinant of life chances and in consequence its role as a source of divergent political interests. This has resulted from processes such as the ``embourgeoisement'' of the working class or the ``proletarianization'' of white-collar work, and from the presence of extensive intragenerational and intergenerational social mobility (cf Abrams et al 1960, Goldthorpe et al 1968). 2. New post-industrial social cleavages are replacing class-based conflict. The significance of class position for voting behavior has decreased as ``new'' forms of social differentiation have become more important for political interests---e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, and production and consumption sectors (cf Dunleavy 1980, Saunders 1981, Huckfeldt \& Kohfeld 1989, Heath et al 1991, Saunders 1990). 3. Because of a general increase in levels of education and ``cognitive mobilization,'' identity-based responses to class-based divisions of interest are being replaced by the expression of preferences that reflect voters' increasing ability to make electoral decisions that are calculative and issue oriented rather than being driven by collective identities (cf Franklin 1985, Rose \& McAllister 1986, Dalton 1996, Heath et al 1991). 4. Values are becoming more important as a basis of party preference and are cross-cutting the impact of social class. In particular, the increasing influence of post-material values has led to a decline in the importance of the traditional, class-based, left-right political continuum for voting behavior. The new left draws its support from the middle classes, weakening the class basis of left-right divisions (cf Lipset 1981 [1960]:509--21, Inglehart \& Rabier 1986, Weakliem 1991). 5. Finally, since the manual working class has declined as a proportion of the electorate, left-wing parties have had to direct their programs toward the concerns of the growing middle classes or face continued electoral defeat. They have therefore moderated the class character of their political appeals and weakened the class distinctiveness of the political choices facing the electorate (cf Przeworski \& Sprague 1986, King \& Wickham-Jones 1990). Problems here: 1. How is class defined 2. How is political preference defined Class voting is fairly straightforward: the propensity for members of one class to consistently vote for one party in significantly higher numbers than for hte other party or parties in the system. But useful measures of class voting must therefore measure both class and party properly. Past articles, including Alford, used fairly simple measures, and treated "left" and "right" as monolithic. This may have produced spurious results, and continue to do so. Instead, he cites studies of European and American politics suggesting that class voting has a more nuanced, and recently stronger, history than earlier studies would suggest. Those who disaggregate "right" and "left", and who make more careful distinctions about "working class" (e.g., between manual labor, skilled blue-collar labor, and blue-collar management like foremen or superintendents) find less evidence for the kinds of developments specified in 1-5 above. },

	Annote = {Classic article on the rise of post-materialist politics and the lack of party structures that accommodate it. Inglehart and Rabier observe that surveys of younger Europeans, and cohort analysis through time, both show signs of the decline of class politics and the rise of post-materialism (less concern for economic growth, more concern for pacifism or environmental policy or similar non-economic issues). They attribute this move to a few crucial factors: the attainment of a high level of wealth; the improved education of this generation of Europeans; the growing share of non-manual jobs or service jobs in the economy; and the consolidation of major party positions at hte center, in ways that do not provide homes for this kind of politics. New Politics parties have tended to be volatile. The 1970s saw wave of economic reform parties which then faded with the economic relief of the 1980s; the 1980s have seen ecology parties on the left and far-right/nationalist parties on the right; whether these will survive or be incorporated into existing mass parties is to be determined (nb - did not happen with the Greens, which have become a smaller generalist party that, with Joschka Fischer, showed that they could adapt to positions of leadership; has not yet happened with the FN, though the impending death of its charismatic leader and the maneuvering of Sarkozy may temper its weight after the late-1990s surge).

	Annote = {Purpose: to define the conditions under which economies which do not correspond to the strictures of neoclassical, monetarist economics, can be competitive in a post-1970s economy; under a rubric known as "diversified quality production", which bears little resemblence to either the Keynesian consensus of the postwar era or the neoliberal Anglo-Saxon model of the post-1970s era. Origins of DQP, the concept: 1. Technical advancement that made fixed production costs lower, allowing smaller production runs and thus "mass customization" possible 2. Institutionally rich settings that stabilized the labor and capital flows that were needed to support low-volume, high-customization mass production 3. A conceptual break with the "flexible specialization" concepts of Sabel and Piore. -FS was grounded in the Italian small-firm example and drew heavily on voluntary communitarianism. DQP originated from the German system, where "hard" institutions and large and small companies were found in the production arena. FS was argued to be a new kind of society suitable to customized mass production; DQP was instead an adaptation of an existing society's institutions to the possibilities of low-volume, high-quality mass production. Origins of DQP, the practice: 1. Not strictly market-driven: technical change increases the options available to management; many options are now available, and choosing among them is difficult 2. Not strictly market-conforming: marketing can change the nature of markets, and prediction of future evolution of markets is difficult; thus the more important question is how a firm configures itself to work in an atmosphere of uncertainty, not what particular market segment it picks 3. Not contained by hte market: where and how the specific factor endowments come into being appears to depend on an institutional exoskeleton that permits cooperation and discourages defection Three "market failures" that need to be accounted for: 1. Cooperative organizational behavior Markets and organizations would appear to revert to heirarchical forms if left to their own devices: between management and labor, and between firms and their suppliers. DQP requires devolved authority to production units, and flexible relations between up- and down-stream units. It also requires a universe of diverse firms in niche markets, that provide the flexibility of reconfiguring production to the firms they supply (e.g., Siemens can reconfigure quickly because a network of small firms exists to supply a diverse and changing set of needs; eliminating that network would eliminate the ability to pull off DQP). The ability for these networks of firms to coexist without attempting to destroy each other; or for management to devolve authority to labor, appears tightly linked to the protection of small firms from the predations of larger ones. 2. Redundant capacity Fast retooling and reconfiguration requires access to both sets of skills that are redundant, and sets of suppliers that may be at times redundant. a. Broad and High skills - employees and labor markets that are both high-skilled and broadly-skilled, to allow production reconfiguration b. Multi-layered organizational structures with devolved authority. Enable each layer in the organization to perform multiple activities and carry out different roles; give it the authority to perform these roles as needed. These are difficult to establish if doubt or uncertainty about managerial or labor motives exists inside the organization; hence the concertation/codetermination role of management and labor appears key. c. Decentralized competence Devolved authority to make decisions about how best to accomplish a task; uncertainty of what exactly needs to be done to deliver the product in DQP (given regular retooling) means firms need to devolve authority to those with immediate knowledge. This requires certain degrees of trust and reliability between different units in the company, which in turn is supported by institutional preferences for labor stability, long employment duration, and co-determination. d. Social peace 3. Collective production input},

In such a situation, the recession could prove long and painful - and even, as in the case of the Continental economies of the 1930s, hostile to free governance. Hence Keynes' General Theory, and its insight into the role of government as pump-primer.

	Annote = {Argument: Ch1 Welfare policies exist to regulate labor. Two mechanisms: 1. By buffering the state against the disruption of mass unemployment 2. By making pauperism sufficiently horrifying as to motivate workers to apply themselves even harder. Why are either necessary? Because capitalism regulates labor markets just as it does product markets - via signals that correct for surplus or scarcity. Downside signals are as important as upside signals, but are less tenable in mass societies. Minor corrections can be endured, but major corrections are a threat to the state. Corrections may include natural disaster, but often in Western history have also included man-made major corrections to economic orders (cf Polanyi, etc). Most such policies are twofold: first, a relief of the most dire conditions of dislocation-caused suffering; and second, a requirement that the succorred work. This both removes the deprivation that endangers the state, and creates the labor behaviors that sustain the market. Origins: Europe - 16th-17th century edicts both on the Continent and in Britain calling on local rulers (either the princes of the HRE or the parishes of England) to care for their poor; made necessary by the growth of the towns and the enclosure of the commons, which both drew in peasants seeking employment and became refuges for the displaced. Oversupply of labor created large-scale beggary. By the 18th-19th century, a new dimension was added or (as in the case of outdoor relief) expanded: the insistance on work accompanying relief. Thus the poor houses that accompanied the "reform", starting in 1832, of the system of Poor Relief that had existed since Elizabethan times. The reduction in outdoor relief and the move to incorporate female and child labor into the work force went hand in hand: protection against the worst deprivation could be had, but only at the cost of work in rather inhospitable conditions, and in ways that ensured the labor supplies needed by the factories. Moreover, this poor relief often was unavailable to independent craftsmen or others of demonstrable skill who were most likely able to find jobs; as such, it speeded the transition from a craft- and guild-based system of production to a factory system, which the craftsmen had avoided as a means of resisting the commodification of labor. Later, democratic societies saw the welfare state playing a different role: as a means of securing votes in mass-voter societies. },

This was successful, but could not be translated into the second stage (skilled mfg) because the availability of capital, skill, and know-how were too limited. The markets were also too small for the economies of scale to kick in. The result was high-cost manufacturing at low quality, requiring greater protectionism and thus even greater restriction of market access. Thus the LA countries that moved to the 2nd phase of import substitution faltered, while the E Asian countries that dropped it in favor of international manufacturing did much better. By what mechanism: the growth of total factor productivity is better promoted by (1) economies of scale, (2) competition with external markets, and (3) exposure to international investment.

	Abstract = {A rrighi, Silver and Brewer (ASB) argue that levels of income in rich and poor countries have not converged while the share of manufacturing in GDP has (in 1990, for example, the share of manufacturing in sub-Saharan Africa's GDP was allegedly as much as 88 percent of what it was in the ``First World'' [Table 2]!). This proposition may be intriguing, if correct. But the au- thors present no persuasive theory to suggest why it should be so. Manufactur- ing has been at the heart of modern economic growth because of its scale economies, principle of specialization, geographical agglomerations, and high incidence of technological change. Why should not more manufacturing activ- ity in the South lead to greater manufacturing incomes, employment, and con- vergence, even if not complete convergence with Northern incomes given the outward shift of the world technological frontier? },
	Annote = {A persuasive response to Arrighi, et al on the pattern of income convergence and industrialization. The author has three critiques: 1. Some of the methods are flawed. The zero-correlation of the relationship between manufacturing as \% of GDP and income appears to be a statistical artifact. 2. Domestic politics are ignored in favor of blaming the entire problem of Southn development on the global international system. Clearly, the evidence since 1980 is that countries can beat the system 3. The numbers used are problematic. Why are other elements of economic growth - services, government - ignored? Why is manufacturing, and not value-added, the unit of measure? Manufacturing says little about the quality of the goods produced, the origin of their designs, and the possibilities of technology transfer or learning. Finally, the notion of a global economic hegemony that requires poor countries to remain poor in order to deliver a set of services at low cost required by rich northern economies. This is directly contradicted by the modes of recent success in E Asia, most of which are dismissed out of hand, and by the ignorance of the specific cases of middle-income industrial countries in a variety of different continents. },

@article{Arrighi:2003,
	Abstract = {This article demonstrates empirically that widespread convergence in the degree of industrialization between former First and Third World countries over the past four decades has not been associated with convergence in the levels of income enjoyed on average by the residents of these two groups of countries. Our findings contradict the widely made claim that the significance of the North-South divide is diminishing. This contention is based on a false identification of ``industrializa- tion'' with ``development'' and ``industrialized'' with ``wealthy.'' Elaborating from elements of Joseph Schumpeter's theory of innovation, Raymond Vernon's prod- uct cycle model, and Pierre Bourdieu's concept of illusio, the article offers an ex- planation for the persistence of the North-South income divide, despite rapid Third World industrialization and despite dramatic changes in the world political-ideo- logical context for development (that is, the shift around 1980 from the ``develop- ment'' project to the ``globalization'' project or ``Washington Consensus''). While emphasizing the long-term stability of the Northern-dominated hierarchy of wealth, the article concludes by pointing to several contemporary processes that may de- stabilize not only the ``globalization project,'' but also the global hierarchy of wealth that has characterized historical capitalism. },
	Annote = {General: Standard tripe about north-south economic divides, the failure of industrialization to bridge the divide, and the need for a new economic order that upsets the hegemony/oligarchy of the developed countries and in particular the United States. Ignores: 1. The actual change in incomes inside the developing countries, and whether there is a sign that the trend in income improvements mirrors that of the first IR or not 2. The variability inside the developing world. East Asia is generally given short shrift as an example; so is Chile and S Africa. 3. Aggregation of the "developed world" includes Africa, which has major political issues, and instead treats the general problem of economic modernization as generalizable across countries. The availability of measures like "share of mfg in the economy" and "ratio of income in 3rd world to income in 1st world" doesn't tell us much about what's actually going on. The article thus tells us something we already know - that development has proven to be difficult - but overlays it with a general critique of economic development policy in general, which is not necessarily good. Notably, lots of success has been had by some nations mostly in Asia, but SE Asia and China and E Asia are different things - by deviating from this, without a lot of punishment from the "economic hegemons."},

@article{Little:2000,
	Abstract = {Abstract A central problem in public health studies is how to make inferences about the causal effects of treatments or agents. In this article we review an approach to making such inferences via potential outcomes. In this approach, the causal effect is defined as a comparison of results from two or more alternative treatments, with only one of the results actually observed. We discuss the application of this approach to a number of data collection designs and associated problems commonly encountered in clinical research and epidemiology. Topics considered include the fundamental role of the assignment mechanism, in particular the importance of randomization as an unconfounded method of assignment; randomization-based and model-based methods of statistical inference for causal effects; methods for handling noncompliance and missing data; and methods for limiting bias in the analysis of observational data, including propensity score matching and sensitivity analysis. },

@techreport{Gordon:2004,
	Abstract = {After fifty years of catching up to the United States level of productivity, since 1995 Europe has been falling behind. The growth rate in output per hour over 1995-2003 in Europe was just half that in the United States, and this annual growth shortfall caused the level of European productivity to fall back from 94 percent of the United States level to 85 percent. Fully one-fifth of the European catch-up (from 44 to 94 percent) over the previous half-century has been lost over the period since 1995. Disaggregated studies of industrial sectors suggest that the main difference between Europe and the United States is in ICT-using industries like wholesale and retail trade and in securities trading. The contrast in retailing calls attention to regulatory barriers and land-use regulations in Europe that inhibit the development of the big box retailing formats that have created many of the productivity gains in the United States. For many decades, the United States and Europe have gone in opposite directions in the public policies relevant for metropolitan growth. The United States has promoted highly dispersed low- density metropolitan areas through its policies of building intra-urban highways, starving public transit, providing tax subsidies to home ownership, and allowing local governments to maintain low density by maintaining minimum residential lot sizes. Europeans have chosen different policies that encourage high- density residential living and retail precincts in the central city while inhibiting the exploitation of greenfield suburban and exurban sites suitable for modern big box retail developments. The middle part of the paper draws on recent writing by Phelps: economic dynamism is promoted by policies that promote competition and flexible equity finance and is retarded by corporatist institutions designed to protect incumbent producers and inhibit new entry. European cultural attributes inhibit the development of ambition and independence by teenagers and young adults, in contrast to their encouragement in the United States. While competition, corporatism, and culture may help to explain the differing transatlantic evolution of productivity growth, they reveal institutional flaws in both continents that are inbred and likely to persist. The final section of the paper identifies the roots of the favorable environment for innovation in the United States compared to Europe. Elements include an openly competitive system of private and public universities, government subsidies to universities through peer-reviewed research grants rather than unconditional subsidies for free undergraduate tuition, the world dominance of United States business schools and management consulting firms, strong United States patent protection, a flexible financial infrastructure making available venture capital finance to promising innovations, the benefits of a common language and free internal migration, and a welcoming environment for highly-skilled immigrants. },

	Annote = {Argument: that most of the divergence in US-Europe productivity growth after 1995 can be explained through a better business environment for risk-taking, and a less restrictive retail environment, in the US vs. in Europe. Thus the big-box store and ICT adoption in services moved faster, and were encouraged by young people willing to take risks and financiers willing to provide them capital. This fits into the framework of Phelps, who argues that institutions supporting risk-taking and creative destruction (particularly financial institutions) do better for long-run economic growth and prosperity. Implication for services: the problem of European services liberalization would suggest, in this context, a long-run slowdown in European productivity growth due to limited economies of scale, etc. },

@article{Iversen:1998,
	Annote = {Statistical evidence for the difficulty of balancing income inequality, fiscal restraint, and employment in an economy dominated by services employment, due to the low-productivity-growth nature of the majority of services. The difficulty of balancing these produces three models - neoliberal, social democratic, and christian democratic - that each choose two of the three, sacrificing the third. Given the ongoing dominance of services and the erosion of mfg in rich industrial democracies, suggests ongoing political problems and tensions. Questions: -=Do we believe this; how far will this go, or can services productivity be preserved? What about the internaitonalization of services? What do changing elements of the world economy mean for how nations can orient themselves via different product strategies in a world market? How much does this depend on the availability of cheap inputs, namely fuel? (e.g., for shipping, etc) Zysman's counterargument: first, services productivity growth is highly possible given IT; most productivity growth in the late 1990scame via ITC in retail and financial services. Second, the disaggregation of production produces new ways for countries to develop comparative advantage, using the same tech that was respondible for disaggregation. },

@article{Mehra:2008,
	Annote = {t's an iPod world, and we just live in it. Or so goes the not-necessarily-unjustified hype. But with the benefits of technological change can come the cost of legal conflict. In particular, a sizeable literature has sprung up focused on the risks that Internet filesharing and digital copying pose for the copyright holders of the recording and film industries. A number of prominent American law professors have endorsed the notion of a tax on digital recording and music filesharing - call it an ``iPod tax'' - with the proceeds to be paid into a fund. A clearinghouse representing rights holders would monitor which and how often works were downloaded, and perhaps, used. The clearinghouse would then use a formula to translate this data into a gauge of the relative popularity of musical works. Finally, the clearinghouse would divvy up the iPod tax revenues to the individual rightsholders. The clearinghouse approach addresses important concerns. On the one hand, it directly addresses the so-called ``piracy'' concerns of the recording and film industries. On the other hand, it creates clear legitimacy for users' noncommercial recording. In doing so, the clearinghouse proposals allow users to freely choose among competing content. In fact, Japan has actually run a very similar system since the early days of digital recording in 1993. The Japanese system imposes a tax on recording media such as blank CDs and DVDs that consumers can use to engage in private home recording. That revenue is then split among copyright holders in the recording and film industries based on measures of the popularity of their works. Just as the American proposals come as a response to widespread Internet filesharing and unauthorized use, the Japanese system was born in the wake of a burgeoning CD rental industry that threatened recording industry coffers. But after a dozen years of experience, faced with the iPod and similar computer memory-based devices, the Japanese decided not to extend their system beyond blank CDs and DVDs to hard-disk based devices, cellphones and more. On the advice of a committee dominated by academics, especially law professors, the Japanese government stopped their digital recording media tax from morphing into an iPod tax. This Article looks at the nature of the proposed American clearinghouse model, and compares it with that of the existing system in Japan. It focuses on how Japanese experts decided that regulatory failures merited killing an extension of their existing system to include a proposed iPod tax. In particular, the Article draws on the Japanese debate to propose a ``friendly amendment'' to structure an American clearinghouse as a user-owned cooperative to reduce the chances of repeating Japan's mistakes.},

@article{Deutsch:2002,
	Abstract = {Music lovers who have complained that compact discs are too costly were officially vindicated yesterday, as five big music labels and three national retailers settled a lawsuit charging them with price fixing. Although the companies did not admit to any wrongdoing, they agreed to refund $67.4 million to consumers who purchased CD's from 1995 to 2000 and eliminate policies that set minimum prices for advertised CD's. In addition, the defendants will give state organizations about 5.5 million CD's to distribute to schools, libraries and other nonprofit groups. Neither the plaintiffs -- 40 states led by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer -- nor the defendants said that they expected the settlement to result in lower prices for recorded music. The lawsuit, filed in August 2000, charged the music industry and retailers with unlawfully colluding to keep the price of CD's artificially high through what are called minimum advertised pricing policies. Those policies stipulated that retailers who accepted subsidies from music companies for advertising CD's could not promote the items below an agreed price. The music companies argued that the pricing policies were intended to help keep independent music retailers in business. Mass retailers like Wal-Mart, they said, often advertised CD's at below cost to draw consumers. Since music retailers carry a much narrower range of merchandise, they could not afford to match the discounted prices, the companies said. A spokeswoman for one defendant said that music retailers could -- and often did -- discount prices through unadvertised specials. Nonetheless, as part of the settlement, all of the defendants agreed to discontinue their minimum advertised pricing policies. The record industry defendants are the Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music Distribution, the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic Corporation, Sony Music Entertainment and the Universal Music Group. The retailer defendants are Trans World Entertainment, Tower Records and Musicland stores. All of the companies agreed to settle yesterday. The settlement did not surprise industry experts, who noted that the last thing the music business needs now is to be viewed as treating consumers cavalierly. ''They very much want to show the world that they are friendly to competition,'' said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''They want to be able to consolidate and to cooperate in using the Web to their advantage, and they want ongoing legislative help to combat piracy.'' Mr. Spitzer said that the settlement ''will provide consumers with substantial refunds and result in the distribution of a wide variety of recordings for use in our schools and communities.'' He said that the donated CD's would have a retail value of about $75.7 million. The lawsuit was just one more problem for the music business. Recording artists have been loudly rebelling at what they claim are restrictive contracts. Retailers have been consolidating and driving hard bargains with the music labels. Many consumers have turned to the Web -- some to illegally download music free, others to legally buy it at a discount. And though most of the major labels are still profitable, their margins are being badly squeezed. ''The music industry has become the poor stepdaughter of the entertainment world, and record companies will continue to have problems with profitability,'' Mr. Nathanson said. Yesterday, many of the defendants issued statements proclaiming their innocence and playing down any negative impact on their businesses from the settlement . ''The truth is, we originally thought we'd have to settle for five times this amount,'' said a spokeswoman for one record company. The official statements were less specific. BMG, for example, said that the minimum advertised pricing policies were ''an appropriate and lawful business practice,'' but that ''reaching a settlement was the best way to resolve this matter.'' The Universal Music Group expressed similar sentiments. ''UMG believes that its MAP policies would have been found by the court to be legal and in complete compliance with both state and federal antitrust laws,'' its statement said. Indeed, the company said its policies ''were procompetitive and geared toward keeping more retailers, large and small, in business,'' but saw settlement as its only recourse.},

	Abstract = {Growth in this model is driven by technological change that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents. The distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a non- rival, partially excludable good. Because of the nonconvexity in- troduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic compe- tition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is de- voted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth. },

@article{Weiser:2003,
	Abstract = {The Internet continues to transform the information industries and challenge intellectual property law to develop a competition policy strategy to regulate networked products. In particular, inventors of ``information plat- forms'' that support the viewing of content-be they instant messaging sys- tems, media players, or Web browsers-face a muddled set of legal doctrines that govern the scope of available intellectual property protection. This un- certainty reflects a fundamental debate about what conditions will best facili- tate innovation in the information industries-a debate most often played out at the conceptual extremes between the ``commons'' and ``proprietary con- trol'' approaches to the Internet and intellectual property policy. This Article proposes a ``competitive platforms model'' as a new concep- tual framework to govern intellectual property and Internet policy. This model suggests that where information platforms will continue to face com- petitive alternatives, intellectual property law and policy should encourage competition among them as a means of driving companies to develop supe- rior products and enabling them to appropriate rewards from their inven- tions. Alternatively, where a particular information platform emerges as the dominant one-for example, in the case of Microsoft Windows in the market for PC operating systems-intellectual property protection against the reverse engineering of its platform standard or user interface should recede. As a strategy to implement the competitive platforms model, this Article proposes a reformulation of the fair use and misuse principles-as developed in both copyright and patent law-to provide a unified, clear, and coherent frame- work for protecting platform standards and user interfaces. Moreover, the competitive platforms model calls upon industry standard-setting bodies and the federal government to reassume the critical coordination and funding roles they served in the early days of the Internet in order to support the development of the parts of the Internet's information infrastructure that are intrinsically open to all and thus are vulnerable to underinvestment.},

	Abstract = {Of the diverse factors motivating technological change, one factor that has received increasing attention in the recent past has been the protection of intellectual property rights. Given fairly recent changes in the international policy ethos where a regime of stronger intellectual property protection has become a fait accompli for most develop- ing countries (and the developed too), it is of some significance to ask whether more stringent protection of intellectual property does indeed encourage innovation. And this is the question which this paper examines, utilising cross-country panel data on R\&D investment, patent protection and other country-specific characteristics spanning the period 1981--95. The evidence unambiguously indicates the significance of intellec- tual property rights as incentives for spurring innovation. },

	Abstract = {FEW beliefs are so well established in the credo of British economic history as the belief that the late Victorians failed. Statistical economists and literary historians, Englishmen and foreigners, late Victorians and moderns have accepted some version of it. The three senses in which Britain is said to have failed are that output grew too slowly because of sluggish demand, that too much was invested abroad because ofimperfect capital markets, and that productivity stag- nated because of inept entrepreneurship. The three are closely related. Slower growing demand, partly an inevitable consequence of new competition in world markets and partly an avoidable consequence of the shortcomings of British merchants and manufacturers, is said to have slowed British growth and, conse- quently, to have dulled the incentive to invest at home. The obstacles to invest- ment were multiplied by imperfect capital markets, which channelled funds abroad to an even greater extent than warranted by the sluggish markets at home. In this milieu entrepreneurs had few opportunities to invest in new technologies. Again, however, the obstacles were multiplied by the inadequate response of the economy, for entrepreneurs were slow to take up even the limited opportunities open to them. Productivity, therefore, is said to have stagnated, worsening Britain's position in foreign markets, driving still more investment abroad, and closing the circle of failure. Few historians subscribe to the whole of this dismal tale, but many believe parts of it. The argument of this essay is that these beliefs are ill founded. },

@article{Morgan:2007,
	Abstract = {Globalization is placing European societies under pressure to change. In the 1990s, researchers identified particular national models of capitalism. These were argued to consist of integrated and reinforcing institutions that created specific rules of the game for economic actors. These rules favoured the development of globally competitive firms in particular sectors where the institutional characteristics of the home society facilitated the building of distinctive types of capabilities. In this view, a global division of labour was developing based on institutional differences. Thus, national policy makers needed to reinforce institutional advantage and institutional specialisation by incremental adaptations to globalization. Reforms needed to be consistent with the underlying model of capitalism. This paper challenges such a view. It argues that firms are highly innovative and use institutions not as constraints but as resources that enable them to build new capabilities. It further argues that institutions are more diverse, malleable and multi-levelled than the national models perspective recognizes. Thus, options for change are much broader than predicted by the path-dependent national models framework. Indeed, the main issue for European societies in response to globalization is to ensure diversity and experimentation rather than simply seeking to reproduce a dominant logic. },

	Annote = {Pre-1960s, regional industrial production was the dominant character of the world economy. Brand and region were linked (e.g. Sheffield Steel, Solignen knives, Meissen porcelain, etc)0 This is now returning, due to 5 factors: 1. Successful 21st century industrial districts in W. Germany, N. Italy, Japan, Denmark, USA (S. Valley), etc 2. Convergence of small and large-firm structures as large firms try to gain control over size through fragmentation into small units, and small firms grow and build centralized units 3. Concentration of product lines in single operating units, even among large firms 4. Transformation of local govt from welfare dispenser to job creator 5. Cooperation of trade unions with firm restructuring as a way of preserving both jobs and firms Question: what consequence does this re-regionalization of economies have for the state? 1. Re-regionalization As a response to international instability, build up regional economies reminiscent of 19th century production centers. ``Flexible specialization'' within these economies. Centers of skill, knowledge, etc that can respond to market changes through strengths provided by networks. Decentralization of production into regions does not occur as a way to punish/suppress labor. Rather, where successful, it often relies on integrating labor into some form of stable arrangement in order to guarantee the requisite skills, knowledge, etc. Fragmentation of production runs and segmentation of markets made huge mass-production business models impractical after about 1980. MAss specialization became more common, such that companies could respond to rapidly changing global markets. That required the ability to call on a wide range of skills and competencies, which in turn required a network of firms able to provide them. Hence the outcome, flexible specialization in regional economies. (Note - skill profile outlined by Sabel correlates well with O'Sullivan's idea about how innovation actually occurs.) Sees many US firms as implementing only a part of this process, in order to try and preserve mass production while better responding to shifting demand. Unclear whether this hybrid model would work (in the case of GM, seems that it didn't). What regionalization is not: subsidized efforts by governments to attract firms; naive attempts to create ``new Silicon valleys''; assumptions that only high-tech has a future, and so abandonment of existing industry to a chimera of new technology.},

	Annote = {Comments at Ziegler seminar 3/15 Question: can we observe changes to the sociological elements of hte business elites of the top 50 German companies? Who are these people, what are their career paths like, are they still ``technical experts'' or have they become more like ``professional managers''? Should we find, cf Fligstein, more financ/economists dominant in elite management? Observed trend: In mid-to-late 1990s, see more econ/business expertise in the German management corps. But engineering still remains important to these top 50. But after 2000, engineers/scientists regain ground against the econ/business trained elites. Note, though, that both engineering and bus/econ gain against law - just that science/eng change faster. Observed trend: most German managers still come from within the same company that they've been appointed CEO of. Observed trend: CEO careers becoming broader within the same company. That is, the CEOs have a lot more experience in a wider set of company sections (parent/subsidiaries, etc) Observed trend: share of CEOs with non-private-sector experience has declined. Thus more private sector experience. And business elite is not growing more international - still around 90\% German, steady at the long term. Average tenure of CEOs has declined. Down about 3 years from 1960-2000. Most CEOs don't finish two 5-year contracts. There's more fluctuation in senior management. Conclusion: There is an emerging internal market for managers from all around the company group. That market also correlates with a shorter CEO tenure than before. },

@techreport{Ziegler:2008,
	Annote = {Comments on 3/15 seminar Main argument: if we want to understand the significance of this particular pension reform, we must look as much at politics after enactment as the politics of policy formulation. Thus implementation is important, and provides another point for interests and preferences to express themselves. How is the new legal structure being used by actors that inhabit that structure. Basics of pension reform: -Pension system has origins in Bismarckian welfare state -3-pillar structure, main pillar is legally required public system, funded by payroll deductions on PAYGO system that are split equally between employer and employee -Public system has no capitalization, thus in 1990s the system really was in crisis; no surplus, no capitalization, thus entire society is face-to-face with a fiscal crisis; and if insufficient income is coming in, then the agency has to raise deductions and this has bad political consequences. Thus a series of reforms: -2001 under Red/Green coalition. This added a possibility for voluntary, individually-funded DC plans. But these are nationally administered; started in 2002 with small deductions into an individual account that you actually own. -Big battle was about contribution structure. Employers didn't want any new non-wage costs added to the wage structure and so in the initial reform, all contribution came from individual reductions -BUT - just before enactment, unions were able to insert a provision for occupational pensions at hte company level with negotiable levels of company contributions. Thus two parallel systems - an individual contribution version and a company-level system. Tax benefits were identical. Plus, occupational plans did not have to be funded by employee payments; negotiation could create system where companies would contribute. -And, company plans had enhanced tax-shielding advantages (not only free of income tax, also free of social contributions). Thus new legislation provided a menu of possibilities Thus - real impact of pension reform isn't in the legislation. It's in the adoption of one or the other alternative and the level of company contribution that results. This is not at the legislative level, it's at the sectoral and company level. Post-enactment politics look like lots of power by unions to force company contributions. How do we analyze what these post-enactment politics are?},

	Annote = {Notes from 3/14 Ziegler seminar Corporate restructuring, not corporate governance. For China, we'd have to first ask about why firms were structured as they were before we talk about how firms were restructured / governed. Old assumptions really don't hold. Political and institutional embeddedness means that the differences in the Chinese political system creat vast differences compared to the European case. Thus: reform that challenges the core of the state socialist system. Create firms that are more competitive, lower cost, internationally competitive. But to do this, you have to change the core of the political/social system: end lifetime employment, end social contract, move from public to private ownership. This risks undermining the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party. This is different from Russian / ECE where old one-party system was already toppled and new regimes whose legitimacy was independent from benefits of old, discredited system. Thus corporate restructuring is very much a political process. Restructuring decisions are made by the state, not hte firm. Either centralized or local, but still political. Economic conditions are important but not sufficient to explain. Politics is the hard constraint, not the economics. Thus the big question is ``will workers accept the change'', and ``does the firm have enough resources to buy off losers'' -Some firms are too poor to restructure, they don't have enough resources to restructure and generate enough gains to pay off losers (buyout workers who lose in restructuring). Result is a political business model. Could not simply lay off workers and could not privatize even when private buyers existed. The major constraint was the worker reaction to reform, generating political instability. Note that standard view is that labor forms interest groups via strong unions. But in this case, the CCP controls the state-run unions, and the unions have no power. Thus why do we still have this fear? Instiutional problems: -Firm-based welfare system with greater burdens for older firms -No unified welfare/social security models -Danwei system = firms provide public goods (schools, hospitals) --Privatisation only possible if the local governments could assume these responsibilities. This created unfunded mandates for welfare that came aloing with restructuring. -Firms with greatest need for restructuring were the ones least capable of it because they lacked resources to be diverted for buying off laid off workers. Pragmatic restructuring politics: -forms and speed vary by locality, firm, etc -Restructuring distinct from privatisation and layoffs. NOT the same thing. Restructuring did not necessarily mean either. -Variation and flexibility to pursue dual agenda of improved economy and improved social network outside firms Trends -Two phases (Pre/post 1997, 15th party congress) -Firm surveys in 2000, 2005, of 400+ firms -Privatisation doesn't get going until mid-1990s -Shareholding system is implemented earlier, because it gives shares to managers and workers within the firm, and is least threatening to the system -Early restructuring required commitments to keeping workers through restructuring; but 2005 survey shows reverse, thus constraint less active. Why? 1997-98, social security system comes online independent from firms, thus less pressure for firms as social institutions. -Also 1997-2005, creation of big stakeholders, particularly as managers -BUT - managers as dominant shareholders has created backlash suggesting that China is selling out the workers and giving wealth to corrupt managers. ``New Left Critiques'' Result of New Left Critiques: -Actually, these have been overstated. SOE privatisation is slow. But change is substantial and important. Fate of SOEs: -1/3 of firms still SOE Results of China's ``Political Business Model'' -Most SOEs reduced, not only 153 in state control, about 1000 at local level. -Economic performance of SOEs much-improved (revenue increases, tax payments, etc all up (+30\%)) -Emergence of national champions, entry to F500 Thus increases in economic resources should allow China to navigate opposition pressures from laid off personnel, provide social safety net, etc. Plus demographic shift reducing labor market such that worker shortage, not gain, becomes problematic. Thus risky change has created resources for more institutional development and reform necessary to make further progress toward a private economy. },

But this is 2/3 of shares of firms, so dumping all these onto the exchanges would dilute the stock price. -Solution: Regulators tried experimental project where they woudl compensate owners of traded shares for the losses they took when non-traded shares became tradeable. Owners of traded and nontraded shares must both agree by supermajority to the move. Results: -Most firms compensated via share grants. Questions is, how much compensation? Answer is, nearly all firms compensated by exactly hte same ratio - 30\% compensation ratio. -State coercion is not about the compensation ratio - rather, about doing the increase in tradeability. So, what's going on: -Isomorphism driven by coercion, norms spread by professionals, and peer imitation -Imitation is the only explainable thing. Use agency theory, think about what interests the various agents have: managers, employees, investment bankers, shareholders of non-tradable shares, shareholders of tradeable shares. Managers: want reform to succeed because regulations give preference to firms that succeed NT Shareholders: low level of compensation; also reform generates lower level of monitoring capability T shareholders: Stats support agency model of isomorphism. The more state ownership, the higher the compensation ratio to overcome state ownership resistance; and (See paper for summary of prediction). Isomorphism is explained by the agency problem. Not supported by isomorphism-only model. Conclusion: -State still has considerable power to encourage reform -But net of state's coercive effects, firm still imitate other firms, more than expected if only thought of state coercion. Uncertainty in what the compensation ratios should be (absent a good math model) means patterned behavior seen -Investment bank advice seems to have little effect },

	Annote = {Presentation at 3/14 Ziegler seminar Not many business historians working on corporate governance. Not much archival work done here. Message: -Debate about CG is completely unresolved -Current approaches to the problem aren't helpful. Approach: -Look at central features of CG (property, finance, stakeholding, politics) -Across 5 countries (US, UK, FR, DE, JP) -What are the main explanatory arguments for variation? What are the central features: -RElations between ownership and management within joint-stock, limited-liability, publicly-held, predominately large-scale enterprises -Balance of power between owners and maangers, consequence of performance -Concentrated vs. Dispersed ownership Concentraded systems: -blockholders -weak securities mkts Dispersed systems -no blockholders -dispersed stockholders- -mkt for corp control -high transparency And then these systems are embedded in broader sets of social/economic institutions. Qualities are oppositional (concentrated vs dispersed, insider-outsider, universal-specialized banking, etc). Have one or the other. Given these, what does the history look like in 5 countries. But what's the take-home lesson: 1. Oppositions between qualities of institutions don't hold. E.g. US now dispersed, wasn't in the past; but relational banking does exist, stakeholder interest does exist, social role of mgr does exist. So you had a stakeholder concern of mgmt in a system of dispersed ownership and fragmented banking. 2. UK shows similar contradictory issues. Things that aren't supposed to be co-located are. E.g., UK had specialized banks but not arms-length banks 3. France: giant, highly liquid securities market in 1900, but barely any giant corporations 4. Germany: increased dispersion of shareholding until 1933, then concentration rapidly after 1945. Earliest MSP laws in world in Germany. 5. Japan has everything - SOEs, dispersed stock market firms, closely held zaibatsu, and institutions supporting all three. Thus - difficult to identify cases of clear separation in history. Coding as dispersal vs concentration or insider vs outsider systems is difficult. And 1945-1990 was a unique period of stability not seen before or since. Thus: explanations good over time in one case fail for comparative explanations; one-time cross-national comparisons are very bad at explaining evolution over time. Thus: dependent variable is a chimera. These two dichotomous explanations don't work. Synchrony/Diachrony. Unclear: -how to explain variation within cases and across time -Greater heterogeneity cannot be explained What's the problem: national cases don't fall into dispersed vs. concentrated systems either cross-sectionally or intertemporally. Part of the problem is the Chandler view of family/entrepreneurial/modern firm evolution, which doesn't really match reality. Another problem is that the alternatives are seen as incompatible oppositions. But no evidence that this is hte case. Alternative idea: Don't think of the dep variable as dispersed/concentrated ownership. Think of it as broad array of possible governance forms we see being experimented with during their development. Look for variance in governance forms within and between states, and the conditions under which they succeeded or failed. Consider national systems as highly contingent, composite systems constructed from the bottom up, often from contradictory processes that don't cancel each other out within a single model. Complimentary, not contradictory, institutions. Older literature looks at this: -alternatives to corporation, Schmoller. -Schmoller and others on: Artels in Russia, Genossenschaften, profit sharing arrangement variation, shipping and fishing -Lamoreaux and Rosenberg; Koberg on alternative ltd liability forms that emerge at the end of the 19th c. GmbH, SARL, limited partnerships, etc. Allow for governance variety within limited liability. US doesn't have much diversity here, hence the deep stock market. What's the significance of this heterogeneity for contemporary debates?},

	Annote = {Question: why divergence between traditional small Japanese companies that keep traditional financial arrangements wtih strong bank ties, and large companies with financial changes but not labor relations. Not bank-based finance, but some kind of new market orientation. Method: look at takeover markets and M\&A Since 1990s: increased M\&A across all five countries; first hostile activity in Germany and Japan; additional increases in US, UK Dichotomy between ``comparative capitalism'' vs. ``economic sociology.'' In latter, less concern with LME/CME typology, more concern with social embeddedness of economies and transactions. Thus, is market activity similar or different across countries? In M\&A markets, three heuristics to think about things: -Problem of valuation -Problem of competition among sellers -Problem of cooperation among suppliers Problem of cooperation: CMEs have much higher incidence of acquistion (target firm remains independent legal entity); LMEs higher incidence of merger (target company does not remain independent legal entity). Purpose of transaction: US/UK buy for technology / innovation / competence. This is rare in Fr/DE/Jp. Problem of competition among suppliers: High variability in ``market discipline'' of underperforming firms within and across countries. Fewer hostile attempts in France/Germany than in US/UK. Problem of valuation: Takeover premia variation. Increase of share price compared t+4 weeks to t-4 weeks around deal annoucement. High increases in the US/UK, lower in Fr/DE, lowest in Japan (~2\%). How to explain this? This variation remains even with control for some possible confounding variables. Also deal value to EBITD - high in US/UK, medium in Fr/DE, low in Japan. Thus LME firms much more willing to pay more to control companies. (MEH): does the variation relate to O'Sullivan's argument about innovation in shareholder value economies? What if the higher M\&A rate in US/UK related to need to buy innovation rather than do it in-house. Who's being bought? Does it produce innovation or just reallocate it? What if this isn't a market for corporate governance, but instead a market for innovation?) Implications for CG: Does the form of transactions relate to function? Are firms being bought on ``markets for corporate control'' such that poorly performing firms are bought, but almost as a protective measure by other firms in the market and not as a measure to improve performance. },

	Annote = {Comments at 3/14 seminar Focus: patient capital. Lynchpin for why LMEs and CMEs are different. Puzzle: lots of work done in PoliSci on political elements of CG regulation changes. Roe, Gourevitch/Shinn on partisan / interest group arguments. Roe as contradicted by Cioffi and Hoepner as to where patient capital comes from: often the center-right, not hte center-left. Coalitional theories as promoted by G\&S help us to understand how this could be the case. In the Italy case, as with other CMEs, big question is will transparency coalitions emerge, when will it, and when will it tear down patient capital. If a transparency coalition emerges and wins, patient capital will be broken down. So what is the measure of ``winning'' that is not ``the end of patient capital''? Believes that this change is MSP legislation pushed through the legislature. Thus Italy: left coalition comes to power, 5 years, supported by transparency coalition, supported by strong technocracy in favor of MSP, and large set of assets to be privatized. Thus perfect storm for convergence of variables that should lead to an end of patient capital. Outcome: patient capital survives much better than the theories would suggest. Thus why is this? Looks like policy entrepreneurs from ctr-left are there, supported by transparency coalition, etc. If the changes don't transpire will all these favorable things, why should we expect them to do so anywhere? Approach: try to understand power resources of the incumbents (managers and blockholders) that allow them to resist strong forces of government and privatization. Thus: what are their interests, what are their common interests, what are their interest representation strategies, how might they resist implementation if they lose in parliament, what can they do at the firm level? Case study of 4 countries: 2 cases of survival of patient capital via shareholder protection (Fr, DE), 2 cases where other factors prevailed (NL, Japan). NL and Japan as the harder case. Economic power as the primary / best kind of power out there. If you have incumbents with this power, give systematic bias towards survival of the old system (Lindblom, structural power). Thus some places where you don't have concentrated ownership, still have manager interests successful. But if managers are often winning, why do we see transnational variation? Must look at diversity of interests transnationally? -Interest definition: where are managers pushing for dereg and liberalization? Business movement strongly opposed to govt and trying to change teh economy, then perhaps general bias in favor of open markets and neoliberal ownership. Structure of argument in which business participates at national level influences outcomes. -Japanese case: major business association is in favor of deregulation from 1990-2002. Not that managers are making law, but allowing certain laws to take place. Shift in 2002 comes when govt moves to regulate board formation. -Mgr power comes from their knowledge of the economy and thus deference and delegated self-regulation. Thus divergence in business is key variable to move away from patient capital. -Voter's don't care about CG. Thus not politically visible. Thus concentrated interests can move the debate. Hence business can drive the evolution of corp gov. Hence need to look at structural support of manager prerogatives.},

	Annote = {Presentation at CG Seminar, 3/14 Issues: 1. Ongoing financialization of the economy, domestically and internationally 2. Increased political salience of CG, and corresponding reforms in many countries 3. Increased regulation in an era of neoliberalism and highly mobile international capital. Thus how to explain this apparent paradox? Legal framework of corporate governance defines the space in which economic actors contract. Legal interventions in the economy have a profound effect on economic actors' behavior as they pursue economic life. Thus law embodies social values and norms channelled through the political system. Provides a way of defining relations between public and private spheres. Questions: 1. What are the formal and substantive characteristics of CG reform in this era? 2. What political/economic conditions triggered / enabled the conditions? How significant are they? US and DE as cases, with VoC as background using these states as paradigmatic cases. DE as deeper institutional environment than the US Arguments: 1. ``New paradigm of international finance capitalism'' Rudolf Hilferding, Weimar Republic finance minister, argues that dense international finance is nearly socialism. Not the case now. Industrial and finance capital are now being loosened. State power now put in service of creating markets where markets had not existed. Thus, contra Ruggie, institutions are now embedded in markets, especially after the collapse of BW. Once this happens, large international actors are in a much different environment. Business strategies change as international markets deepen. Financial institutions in CMEs start to defect to new business models focused on maximum profit growth. LME firms see enormous opportunity in exploiting newly open international markets, given their already-existing expertise in highly deregulated markets. CG reform is the product of this series of changes and the interest groups they produce. No reform occurs without both interest group reforms and policy entrepreneurs (as with Tiberghien). Policy entrepreneurs move into new strategic environments, looking for strategic advantage. (Puzzle: we speak of coalitional arrangements as in Gourevitch and Shinn. Why do we see a consistent trend in CMEs and LMEs toward shareholder interests, when shareholders in all economies are a weak force? Vast differences in shareholder location in the economy create giant collective action problems in the US; elsewhere, relatively few shareholders. So someone else must be doing this. Cioffi argues that large financial institutions are proxies for shareholder interests, but not perfect ones.) State actors involved: differences in party system, political ideology make big differences in CG reforms. Parties in the Ctr-L take the lead on CG reform against parties of the Ctr-R. REasons are both historical and programmatic. Reform appeals to C-L philosophy of regulating the economy against financial/managerial prerogatives. Second, erosion of working class base for C-L parties have declined; and economic credibility has declined. Thus since 1990s, reorientation of CL parties to ``economic modernization'' platforms that can attract new constituencies - including individual shareholders and financial actors. See Schroeder government, ``Neue...'', as against CDU/FDP that were more aligned with managers. Thus liberalism plus regulation. But major banks didn't really come along, and the party reorientation has been an unstable arrangement. And, although large financial firms have an interest in expanding markets, but are also run by managers. Want enhanced market activity but don't want to limit their own prerogatives. Thus financial firms as political actors have contradictory impluses. Result is schnizophrenic reform lobbying. Consequnce: formal legal and regulatory output from CG reform efforts. Proliferation of new rules, creation of new regulatory regimes, encroachment of securities law into state corporate law by SARBOX and subsequent SEC reforms. But if you look at constituent areas of law ``juridicial nexus of corporations'': securities law, corporate/company law, labor law. Labor is weak in the US but vitally important in comparative perspective. Result is very different picture of what constitutes CG reform. Results: lots of pro-shareholder change in securities law around the world (MSP, disclosure, transparency). Much more limited degree of change in corporation law, less convergence; empowering of board as shareholder agent. And virtually no change in labor law. 2 areas: Market-enabling rules Structural regulation (rules that touch directly on arrangements of power in private sphere. Much more political resistance here than for mkt-enabling reg. This mostly deals with company and labor law, and thus the consequence for securities law vs. company/labor law.)},

	Abstract = {The paper examines internal diversity within national models of capitalism in Europe, with a particular concern to firm financing and corporate governance patterns. It is suggested that a relatively small number of firms have moved into a new institutional context, consisting of common international institutions and practices, while the large majority of firms continue to operate in a more slowly evolving set of domestic institutions or rules. Between these two models lies a set of `hybrid' firms, displaying some features of each. Empirically, the paper examines changes since the early 1990s in firm financing and corporate governance based on firm size. It finds preliminary evidence to support the thesis of increasing diversity, but also that national patterns of firm finance are still distinct.},

	Annote = {Presentation at CG Seminar, 3/14 Motivation: changes in German PE (financial system, corporate governance) suggested no longer a ``german model'' of corporate governance. Dualism emerging: traditional Hausbank model plus a new model that was less bank-centric. To what extent can we validate this empirically in Germany and beyond? Thus: is there growing internal diversity in models of corporate governance? Start with finance as core to the variation in models of capitalism, examine the role of ``patient capital'' and ``asset-specific investments'' in coordinated capitalism amidst an environment of supposed ``convergence.'' Patient capital allowed excellence in specific forms of innovation, particularly those requiring asset-specific investment. If this is changing, what does it mean for the kinds of competitive advantages that these coordinated economies have? Two models: ``International Model'' (large firms, publicly traded and listed, high degree of ``financialisation'' in profit and control). Financialization concerned with both the shareholder value idea (firm goal is generating profits) and the separation of ownership and control. Financialisation driven by size. Larger firms are more ``financialized.'' International model: 1. Use financial markets 2. Shift to market finance 3. Common set of transparency rules (adoption of IFRS in EU, 2005; stock exchange consolidation and convergence of listing requirements; structural power of rating agencies) 4. Common set of CG practices (shareholder value, stronger boards, increased MSP, performance pay for executives; variance of the strength of these norms between and within countries 5. Increase of outsider impact (decline of blockholding varied across major EU economies, slight downward trend; decline in cross-shareholding; decline in relationship banking (better evidence for this); fewer control-enhancing mechanisms (unequal voting rights, role of EC in setting this pattern, recent EC report suggesting that control-enhancing mechanisms are in decline) SME World 1. No major shift to public listings Increase in IPOs on the London market is an exception in Europe; most other exchanges have seen declines; works for all firms and only for domestic firms. 2. Modest shift to PE/VC Buyout and replacement capital has risen, but startup capital has risen less; large increases in UK but not across Europe, particularly compared with US 3. Shift from bank loans to other forms of mediated finance Decling in short-term but not long-term bank borrowing. Increased use of leasing and factoring (it and fr); rise in use of overdrafts. But SME finance generally very stable 4. National financing patterns persist (France an exception in Europe) 5. Limited use of bond or asset-backed securities as funding sources EUR100m generally the lower bound for bond issues. Too big for most SMEs. But if banks could securitize SME loans, SMEs would enjoy expansion of securities markets. But securitization of SME loans hasn't happened to great extent (comparative with other forms of loan securitization in Europe?) 6. ? How to explain: 1. Gap between listed and unlisted 2. Technical and cost issues for large vs. small firm financing 3. Scope for institutional choice for firms may have been expanded by reforms in Europe. Thus reforms are promoting diversity, not convergence 4. Institutional complimentarities drive persistence (German SMEs resist IFRS given threat to ownership control) Effects: 1. Is there a demise of patient capital for large firms, and what does that mean for CMEs? How important is patient capital finance to CME functioning? 2. Is bifurcation only an intermediate stage, and SMEs will eventually become ``financialized''? But what to make of resistance of SMEs to expansion of these international standards as applied to them? },

	Abstract = {We study a positive theory of stagnation and growth aimed at understanding the large variations in growth outcomes across actual economies. The theory points to the fundamental role played by vested interests in determining policies which are key to the growth process: some agents seek to prevent the adoption of new technologies. We develop a model of technology adoption, and show how technological innovation may sow the seeds of its own destruction. In particular, we find that the equilibrium is characterized by a long cycle of stagnation and growth. Over this cycle, incumbent innovators have sufficient political influence that new technologies are prohibited, and only as these incumbents are phased out of the economy will new innovation occur. In formalizing our theory we make a methodological contribution by characterizing dynamic voting equilibria in which voters must forecast the effects of different current policies on future prices and policy outcomes.},

	Abstract = {What determined the multinational expansion of British, French and German banks in the pre-1914 era of globalization? The paper empirically investigate that issue by using an original panel data based on a sample of 55 countries. The dependent variable, aiming at measuring the intensity of cross-border activities operated by banks from foreign locations, is the number of foreign branches and subsidiaries. Explanatory variables are mainly selected on the base of the eclectic theory of multinational banking, but also include institutional indicators suggested by recent studies, such as legal family and adherence to the Gold Standard. Regressors captures the impact of economic integration (trade and capital flows), information development, institutional and economic characteristics of the host-market, and exchange rate and country risk factors. The results suggest that multinational banking was not an homogenous phenomenon, as banks responded differently to economic and institutional factors. Consequently, the French and German pattern of multinational expansion significantly diverged from the British pattern. },

	Abstract = {We use a moral hazard model to compare monitored (nontraded) bank loans and traded (nonmonitored) bonds as sources of external funds for industry. We contrast the theoretical conditions that favor each system with the historical conditions prevailing when these financial systems evolved during the British and German industrial revolutions. To study persistence, we consider an entry model where financiers take the industrial structure as given when they lend and firms take the financial system as given when they borrow. We show multiple equilibria can exist, compare equilibria in welfare terms, and discuss their robustness to coordination between lenders and borrowers. },

	Abstract = {The rise of Western Europe after 1500 is due largely to growth in countries with access to the Atlantic Ocean and with substantial trade with the New World, Africa, and Asia via the Atlantic. This trade and the associated colonialism affected Europe not only directly, but also indirectly by inducing institutional change. Where ``initial'' political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights. These changes were central to subsequent economic growth.},
	Annote = {Atlantic trade provided better profits and profit opportunities than Med or overland trade. Hence it created a group of wealthy and therefore politically powerful merchants with an interest in constraining royal prerogatives and establishing property rights. In turn, this set these nations on a path to rapid economic development compared with Europe's interior. Among states with Atlantic ports, the key factor in divergence was the initial state of royal absolutism, which then set the terms for further developments of law. Cf O'Brian, argument that the ability to do rent-seeking was diminished by the Glorious Rev and the supremacy of Parliament, because authority was now too divided for low-cost rent-seeking to be effective. Lots of interesting possibilities by the firms: East India Company was the only firm to support James II and royal absolutism over William and parliamentary prerogatives. Who was in the EIC vs. in other companies (royal charter or not?).},

@article{198802,
	Abstract = {Between 1660 and 1815 the British government managed to appropriate extraordinary and ever increasing amounts of revenue without much difficulty and without provoking tax revolts. Its success owed something to economic growth, which widened and deepened the base for taxation, but far more to an efficient and politically acceptable selection of the commodities and social groups imposed upon to carry the fiscal burden of its expansionary foreign and military policies. Despite the antipathy they arouse, foreign and military policies. Despite the antipathy they aroused, for administrative and political reasons excises and stamp duties imposed on goods and services produced and sold within the kingdom made the greatest long-term contribution towards Britain's rise to the status of a great power. Even at times of pressing military necessity taxes collected by the central government of an aristocratic state did not become manifestly more regressive. And with the introduction of an income tax during the long war with Revolutionary France their incidence probably shifted in a progressive direction.},
	Annote = { SEE (p24) Moreover, policies designed to foster exports, shipping, shipbuilding and the availability of seamen for the Royal Navy effectively precluded the taxation of exports and the carrying trade.9 So what was firm interest? This is pre-high-IR, pre-dominance in the international textile trade, etc. Where did firms come in? Why were exports preferred to the point where they couldn't be taxed, especially if you buy the argument made by O'Brien that economic growth contributed little to the growth in revenues? Note: -Tried to tax the things that were most price-inelastic -Excise taxes grea in part because income grew faster than prices, so people's level of demand expanded despite overall tax expansion. -Excise taxes on goods consumed mostly by the wealthier classes formed the basis of British finance until the Napoleonic wars. They were not levied on exports, only on imports and domestic goods. Income taxes were only possible when faced with obth the mortal danger of Napoleon and the increased debt burden at the end of a century of war. Only when Pitt demanded, and got, a much higer level of taxation than had been tolerated in the past, and that taxation failed to produce results, did income taxation enter into the realm of the possible. -Income taxes only survived the Napoleonic war. By 1816, they were revoked, and by 1820, Britain was back on Gold. Note: this suggests greater detail to the argument by Borda on British fiscal prudence vs. French. },

@article{Bordo:1991,
	Abstract = {CONCLUSION While the Napoleonic wars after 1797 offered the curious spectacle of faithful Albion abandoning the gold standard and perfidious France maintaining convertibility of the franc, these war finance regimes were the consequence of each nation's credibility as a debtor. Given its long record of fiscal probity, coupled with its open budgetary process in Parliament, Great Britain could continue to borrow a substantial frac- tion of its war expenditures at what were relatively low interest rates. British tax rates did not vary much over most of the eighteenth century as peacetime surpluses offset wartime deficits to pay off the accumu- lated war debts. Taxes would not have been greatly increased during the Napoleonic wars except that their duration imposed a debt burden much higher than the eighteenth-century norm, requiring a rise in the tax rate to sustain the nation's credibility as a borrower. France, on the other hand, had squandered her reputation in the last decade of the ancien re'gime and the Revolution. Her dependency on taxation did not reflect any superior fiscal virtues but rather the opposite. Borrowing would have been exceedingly costly and the public was skeptical of the empire's fidelity. Inherited credibility resolves this paradoxical pairing of fiscal regimes. },
	Annote = {Good argument about how tax system credibility transmutes into financing capability. The British, with a more advanced financial system and greater governmental accountability, could borrow more at lower rates and abandon gold because of greater reliability of repayment. The French could not, because of past experiences of non-repayment, deficits in peacetime, and failed commitments to fiscal prudence. Transparency plays a big role. The post-1688 dominance of Parliament was important in securing the transparency of British finances, which meant that hte public and the financial markets would regularly exact penalities on a state that practiced fiscal imprudence. Hence the pressure on Pitt to repeatedly reform and strengthen British finances, and their very good track record at repayment after the wars of the 18th century. France, despite attempts to make similar commitments, was unable to honor them with any reliability. Question: where are the firms? What did business do? How large an influence did business have?},

The existence of this equity return premium has been known for generations: more than eighty years ago financial analyst Edgar L. Smith (1924) publicized the fact that long-horizon investors in diversified equities got a very good deal relative to investors in debt: consistently higher long-run average returns with less risk. As of this writing--- October 16, 2007, 11.44 PDT---the annual earnings yield on the value-weighted S\&P composite index is 5.53\%. This is a wedge of 3.22 \% per year when compared to the annual yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected bonds of 2.31\%. The existence of the equity return premium in the past offered long-horizon investors a chance to make very large returns in return for bearing little risk. It appears likely that the current configuration of market prices offers a similar opportunity to long- horizon investors today.},

	Abstract = {This paper documents the importance of shares in joint stock companies in aligning disparate interests and instituting representative government in 17th century England. The paper identifies a 70 percent increase due to shareholding on the probability of support for reforms by members of parliament during England's Civil War (1642-48). The paper suggests that shares allowed a broad spectrum of investors to benefit from new opportunities overseas. Because the rights needed to profit from overseas investment belonged to the executive, shareholding aligned incentives in favour of constitutional reforms. These reforms led to representative government and overseas public investments crucial for economic growth.},

	Abstract = {This paper integrates elements from the theory of agency. the theory of property rights and the theory of finance to develop a theory of the ownership structure of the firm. We define the concept of agency costs, show its relationship to the `separation and control' issue, investigate the nature of the agency costs generated by the existence of debt and outside equity, demon- strate who bears these costs and why, and investigate the Pareto optirnality of their existence. We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors in- fluencing tht- creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem. The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frcqucntly watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give thcmsclvcs a dispensation from having it.

	Annote = {Coase -Boundaries of the firm are defined by the relative size of transaction costs needed to manage the firm vs. transaction costs needed to contract with outsiders to perform the same function. Vertical integration exists where it produces lower costs from contracting and coordination than gaining the same end through market interaction would. The firm forms a series of general contracts, within which the mangement has broad latitude to dictate what happens, and thus doesn't have to renegotiate contracts every time it changes to respond to changing market conditions. Mergers occur to the extent that the marginal management cost of the added firm is less than the ongoing coordination cost between the two firms. Managers provide real value-added services of coordination and organization. Depending on the ability of a manager, there are limits to the scope of enterprise they are capable of managing. Hence the size of firms will vary based both on firm skill and on other variables influencing the transaction cost. Williamson, ``The Logic of Economic Organization'' Critical behavioral assumptions: -Bounded rationality -Presence of opportunism Results: incomplete contracting, adaptive decisionmaking (opportunism), credible commitments matter (downside of opportunism), and various sanction mechanisms will develop. Microfoundations provided by Coase give testable outcomes: do the corporate governance structures that we observe match the transactions facing firms in those structures? In other words, is the form of corporate governance incentive-compatible with the set of transactions (and implicit costs) observed by the firm? Debt/Equity influence: two different types of contracting. Debt assumes long-term reliable interest payments, etc - requires knowing a lot about the firm and its reliance. But it's also arms-length. Equity provides easier exit options, but gives the investor access to management and control. Might imagine that one form of financing might be better than another when looking to finance general investment vs. specific investment, in unpredictable markets (97). Joskow, ``Asset Specificity and the Structure of Vertical Relationships: Empirical Relationships'' -Coordination problems from specific investment will be lower if the investment is internalized -Incomplete contracts are, by definition, imperfect governance mechanisms and therefore impose ongoing coordination costs -Theory of vertical integration: spot markets are unsatisfactory when large specific investments required. Contractual guarantees iinsufficient to generate those investments in an environment of uncertainty. -Costs are related to information uncertainties tied to monitoring, etc -The same is true of tasks: novel engineering / tasks will probably occur in-house, generic engineering can be outsourced. Hart, ``Incomplete Contracts and the Theory of hte Firm'' 'Firm as a collection of incomplete contracts and the corresponding need to allocate residual control rights' Residual rights of control = rights to fill in over time areas uncovered by contract. Key elements -If an individual is solely responsible for asset returns, he should own the asset -If there are increasing returns to management of a firm, the firm should grow -Firms with supplier relationships that are fractional - e.g., only one component of a each's business - will contract, not merge -Declining industries will merge to save on overhead costs Generally, framework of incomplete contracts, residual rights, and the problem of how best to allocate those rights - via contract, ownership, or employment - can form the basis for understanding firms. Demsetz , ``The Theory of the Firm Revisited'' Argument: information costs should be given greater weight. We have to treat the profit-maximizing element of firm behavior as something constrained by scarce resources. Information, whether of the market or of the firm, is not readily available. To the extent that it becomes so, through technological change, presumably the possible firm size or complexity would increase. But in any case, information - about contracts, the future, the possible contingencies, etc - all is limited. Proper cost to consider is management + transaction cost. The former is the monitoring cost, the latter the contracting cost. Both are present in either a vertical relationship or a contractual one, though in different amounts. The question is whether one relationship or the other is better at minimizing the sum. Since transaction cost is heavily influenced by information - about production, skill, etc - held within the firm, it has a major impact on whether it's rational to integrate or not. Elements of contract nexus making it more ``firm-like'' -An agreement to specialize. How much is key. More specialization = more integrated. -Length of time -Reliance on direction to fulfill terms of the contract Knowledge and the firm -Knowledge needed within the firm is conditioned on how close its relationships are to the firms that use its products. Steel firms producing steel feedstocks for sale to a wide set of audiences don't need to know how to make it into structural shapes. Or the firm could cater to the construction market alone and produce such shapes internally. Implicitly, then, intermediates and finished goods carry knowledge in them that substitutes for knowledge held by the consumer Winter, ``On Coase, Competition, and the Corporation'' Does ``transaction cost'' explain configurations of firm competencies? -Firms as major repositories of productive knowledge -Evolutionary approach as understanding the firm as an accumulation of responses to production problems in an environment of bounded rationality -Transaction approach as understanding the firm as an accumulation of responses to exchange problems in an environment of bounded rationality },

	Annote = {Argument: you can construct a distinct theory of the firm based on firm competency, as opposed to a Coasean transaction cost framework. Problem with txn cost perspective: insufficient attention given to the major role played by technological innovation in the firm. Firms are organizations for producing and commercializing technological innovation as a basis for competitive advantage. Where competence appears: 1. Entrepreneurs. The organization of disparate functions into a productive whole is a competency function, performed by entrepreneurial individuals 2. Tacit vs. explicit knowledge. The role of knowledge that can't be written down (e.g., how a team functions, which elements of that team are best at what in what circumstances, how a product might be modified in non-traditional ways, etc) Why do firms exist: 1. Two ways for individual to recognize gains to his/her competency: start their own firm, or contract with another firm (Get a job). (Note - since the initial conception of the firm often persists in firm structure and behavior, the entrepreneur fills a behavioral role here, too) 2. Firm boundaries determined by the limits of real competence existing inside the firm. Firms will continue to enjoy increasing returns to scale to the extent that they continue to grow in ways complementary to existing competence stocks. They will also find vertical integration useful to the extent that it allows them to keep in house competencies difficult to communicate to others. 3. Unfamiliarity or unpredictability. Technological innovation is unpredictable and therefore requires close monitoring to decide whether investments are paying off. Such monitoring is easier in a vertically-integrated firm.},

@techreport{Delong1997,
	Address = {Berkeley},
	Annote = {Four explanations for why the firm as ``command economy'' wasn't subject to the same fate as the Soviet economy. 1. Parapublic government function, supported by government. Having large corporations around makes the government's life easier. Tax collection, benefits administration, etc all are handled at hte corporation level. Especially in a government-wary state like the US, means that the corporation relieves the pressure on the government to do these things. 2. Industrial evolution Firm size may generate increasing returns to scale. Furthermore, to the extent that those returns reach an inflection point, the market will punish firms that are either not large enough or too large, because their profits will be insufficient to justify their investments (Firm as profit-making organization distinct from firm as productive organization, the former being much more sensitive than the latter) 3. Coordination Where exact coordination of goods is required, and information is imperfect, corporate control allows better management of production than markets. Large corporations will dominate in these areas. See the auto companies (n engines, n bodies, n doors, etc) 4. Corporate governance The USSR planned economy lacked a means of corporate governance that imposed real consequences on individuals who mismanaged firms. The capitalist system of governance has well-developed ways of doing this. Thus managers are given large amounts of discretion but regularly monitored, both internally and by the market, so that they don't abuse that discretion (or simply use it to unsatisfactory ends). Thus the CEO is both employee (of the shareholders) and boss (of the rest of the employees). That said, CEO's aren't removed too often, still get paid a lot, and shareholder democracy appears not to work very well. Nevertheless, peer pressure and sanction are both useful tools even in this circumstance. NOTE: What follow are Brad's comments at the 3/14 Ziegler seminar Starting with Smith, where the market is so incredible but the entrepreneur as a commander of an economy. Market-enabled division of labor is not done; the division of labor is not negotiated on the spot market, but rather dictated by the boss. Thus corporations take on aspects of command economy. Polanyi and Drucker: Polanyi argues that a market society is unstable and unbearable; Drucker saying a market society is unavoidable and unbearable. Command economies problematic: welfare states can redistribute, but the redistributed stuff still used to buy stuff on markets; command socialist economies still needed managers to run firms like market firms. 1.3 million people today work for Wal-Mart, under a distributed command umbrella, and Wal Mart is highly profitable. Thus there must be forces that create large corporations and make them sustainable. Thus economists are confronted with a quandry: why are capitalist command economies (Firms) sustainable and command economies (socialist) don't. So how to explain this? Drucker: efficiency is in the hands of the manager. Command hinges on manager competence. Thus the market in which the corporatino was embedded was a set of restrictions on managerial discretion imposed by the stakeholders: workers, owners, customers, others. Managerial transgression of these restrictions generates rapid responses (strikes, firing of managers, boycotts / flight, etc). Thus there are markets out there that impinge on managers of command firms and impose discipline that didn't exist in socialist command economies. Thus, Galbraith: this is all good and the fences don't matter very much to economic efficiency, and creates professional interests in managers for good management. Thus managers become reproducing within this set of constraints, and good management generates good outcomes. All the various stakeholders are satisfied, can get along doing other things (working, living, enjoying wealth, etc), and managers can do their thing. In contrast, Berle-Means view of the modern corporation as a perversion of private property that puts bad managers at its head. Control by stakeholders had emasculated by FDR, thus supervision of management isn't needed anymore, and so there's no outside threat to managerial discretion. Thus we need to put controlers back into the equation, because other alternatives wouldn't work. Return of control would remove managerial slack. Then Mark Roe: sacrificing the diversifiers (diversification of risk, diversification of portfolios) gives up the ability to build corporations of size and efficiency. Thus we need to reempower the controlers without causing them to immediately channel assets out of hte firm. Thus the apotheosis of financial organization: takeover artist as diversified controllers. Firm shareholdings were generally diversified, but bad management would prompt takeover artists to consolidate the shareholders, fire the mangers, appoint new ones, and restore efficiency. Thus the end of the 1970s. But - takeovers didn't end lavish pay and inefficiency. 1980s saw an explosion of pay of managers. Thus the Jensen counter that the Galbraithian corporation had managers that were too weak, not too powerful. Thus you need to enhance the discretion of top managers, so they wouldn't see each other as peers but as competitors, and that CEOs needed to have major equity at stake in the firm they ran. This would align incentives. But this also didn't work well. So we really don't know how this works, why it varies, etc. No good durable views of CG. New phenomena: growth of Private Equity as a market segment itself - hard to understand unless either the corporation is undermined by modern firms, or in fact this is just a short-run phenomenon. Also source of M\&A energy: how much came from merging as monopoly power; how much is that it's nearly impossible to downsize an enterprise and thus acquisitions allow you to get ahold of cash flow; or perhaps the Galbraithian empire building corporation is still there, given inefficiency of M\&A. Thus we used to have a theory (Galbraith or Drucker) of how corporation command economies were managed, and in whose interest.

	Abstract = {We develop a model in which the dependence of the brokerage commission rate on share price provides an incentive for brokers to produce research reports on firms with low share prices. Stock splits therefore affect the attention paid to a firm by investment analysts. Managers with favorable private information about their firms have an incentive to split their firm's shares in order to reveal the informa- tion to investors. We find empirical evidence that is consistent with the major new prediction of the model, that the number of analysts following a firm is inversely related to its share price. },

Contributions to the project deal with the state of the art in analytical, computational, and econometric methods of analysis of household portfolio choice, identify stylized facts and trends observed in five major countries, and discuss issues relating to the portfolios of two important population groups, namely the elderly and the rich. In this paper, we integrate the main findings of the project, compare portfolio behavior across countries, and contrast theoretical predictions to empirical findings. This allows us to identify a number of stylized facts and portfolio puzzles that future theoretical and empirical research should attempt to analyze and resolve. },

@article{Veverka1999,
	Abstract = {You may not know Mark Coker, but he's in your corner. The 33-year-old public relations executive from Los Gatos has launched a Web site that is intended to bolster the rights of individual investors. The site, www.BestCalls.com, is a free directory listing thousands of company teleconference calls, and it could become a revolutionary tool in the small investor's battle against selective disclosure of material information. The site lists the schedules and access information for analyst telephone conference calls, which often are closed to mom-and-pop investors. By registering at the site, investors can have e-mails sent to them telling when companies whose stock they own have scheduled such conferences. ``We haven't created a Web site, we've created a cause,'' Coker says. The entrepreneurial Coker bootstrapped the site's startup, using his own cash and employees from his small public relations firm. While he doesn't charge companies or users of the site, he hopes to sell advertising to fund the operation. Interest in the site is already running high. It's no secret that the playing field isn't always level between Wall Street's big guns and the little guy. And one of the advantages that major shareholders often enjoy is access to telephone conference calls that companies conduct shortly after reporting their quarterly financial results, usually after the market has closed. Corporations often invite a select audience to listen to their chief executives and chief financial officers explain their most recent performance. The clubby group often includes sell-side financial analysts from brokerages, buy-side analysts and portfolio managers from institutional investors such as mutual funds, individuals with big stakes in the company and sometimes members of the press. An immense amount of information is sometimes exchanged during these briefings, which usually are toll-free with the companies picking up the tabs. Analysts are encouraged to ask questions while individual investors, when allowed to participate, are not. The press is sometimes allowed to listen but usually banned from asking questions (which is appealing to some, I suppose). Interesting tidbits that aren't included in press releases often are revealed during these sessions. And Coker wants all shareholders to be able to hear the information at the same time. Right now, it's a mixed bag. Some companies, such as Yahoo and Inktomi, open their conference calls to all shareholders and the press. Others, meantime, allow only Wall Street analysts. What's more, some companies provide free taped-delay versions via telephone or the Internet at scattered times after the briefing. Proponents of this approach argue that every investor doesn't need to hear the briefing live because the markets are closed, and all shareholders have plenty of time to digest the information before the next day's opening bell. On the other hand, some companies allow investors but ban the press. Or, conversely, others prohibit small investors from listening to the calls but allow news organizations instead. Opinions vary, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is vague on the issue, which leaves companies scratching their heads. Some advisers, such as securities lawyer Boris Feldman of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich \& Rosati in Palo Alto, advocate letting the press act as a proxy for the rest of the market. As long as most of the sell-side financial analysts and major wire services are on the call, the marketplace is getting the information in a fair and efficient manner. Feldman says companies aren't obligated to include investors in conference calls, suggesting that it's better policy to exclude them because mass audiences can sometimes cause conferences to ``become too bland.'' ``Do you have to let the guy from Boca on the call? Absolutely not,'' Feldman recently told a group of investor relations professionals. ``But you have to be ready to get flamed'' by the unhappy individual investors, he noted. Feldman contends that too many investors on a call actually inhibit management from being very forthcoming and encourage executives to dribble out juicier information later in private one-on-one situations with influential analysts and shareholders. That sometimes spurs a deeper degree of selective disclosure, which is precisely what companies should try to avoid, Feldman argues. (For those interested in learning more about disclosure issues and conference calls, you can read several of Feldman's articles on the subject posted on his firm's Web site at www.wsgr.com.) But Coker, who has been investing since he was a teenager, sees it differently. If he has his way, someday all public companies will open their investor teleconferences to everyone. Period. ``I think we're going to blow the door wide open,'' Coker says. OOPS: Looksmart, an Internet directory of Web sites, said that its recent private placement was one of the largest rounds of funding by a private Internet media company. In Wednesday's column, Street Smarts wrongly reported that it was the largest round raised by such a company.},

U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon approved the plan this week, which brings to $264.3 million the total amount collected on behalf of former Enron employees who had 401(k) plans with company stock. The judge also approved about $23 million in legal fees and $874,902 in legal expenses, which will be subtracted from the $264.3 million figure. Northern Trust was the trustee of Enron employees' 401(k) plan in 2001 when the company went into bankruptcy. The plaintiffs alleged Northern Trust should have adequately diversified the plan funds such that Enron's bankruptcy would not have led to such large losses. Under the settlement Northern Trust neither admits nor denies the allegations. Attorneys for the employees previously settled with former Enron officers and directors for $85 million and sold a settlement claim from Enron in bankruptcy court for $135 million. The only remaining defendants in the case are former CEO Jeff Skilling and the late Chairman Ken Lay. Attorneys for the employees have filed a request to substitute Lay's estate as a defendant.$},

	Annote = {Recent research has documented large di!erences among countries in ownership concentration in publicly traded firms, in the breadth and depth of capital markets, in dividend policies, and in the access of fims to external finance. A common element to the explanations of these di!erences is how well investors, both shareholders and creditors, are protected by law from expropriation by the managers and controlling shareholders of firms. We describe the di!erences in laws and the e!ectiveness of their enforcement across countries, discuss the possible origins of these di!erences, summarize their consequences, and assess potential strategies of corporate governance reform. We argue that the legal approach is a more fruitful way to understand corporate governance and its reform than the conventional distinction between bank-centered and market-centered financial sys- tems. },

	Abstract = {External finance is critical for less established entrepreneurs, so poor investor protection can hinder competition. We model how lobbying by incumbents may reduce access to finance in countries where politicians are less accountable to voters. In a broad cross-section of countries and industries, we find that (i) the number of producers and entry rates are positively correlated with investor protection in financially dependent sectors, and (ii) countries with more accountable political institutions have better investor protection. },

	Annote = {Three broad assertions of prerequisites in a model of democratic transition: Ingredients 1. Need for national unity, defined as stable outside borders 2. Need for entrenched conflict between various social groups 3. Need for common acceptance of democratic rules 4. Need for habituation of the electorate and politicians to these rules Sequencing: You can't accomplish all of this at once. To do so is to invite destabilization because of the complexity of the task. Possible sequencing for success: National unity, then struggle, then compromise, then habituation (as in the Turkish model of postwar democratization, born first of Turkish nationalism and then thrown into crisis by the 1960-61 military coup and then redemocratized by compromise between social actors who then became habituated to this way of acting out of concern for a repeat coup. What this rejects: 1. High level of economic prosperity 2. Prior consensus on the rules 3. Mass education 4. Social welfare or other provision Why: economic growth (in Polanyian terms) is said to drive contentious politics - but other things could serve, too; prior consensus would give you nothing to argue about, and therefore little need for democracy (democracy is not about maximal consensus - it is about minimal agreement on how to come to workable compromises on issues of contention; if you have prior agreement on a certain set of bargains, this will in no way help you when a new set of issues come up. It's about process, not product).},

@article{Bunce2000,
	Annote = {What lessons can we draw from the research on democratic success? Two forms: cross-regional and regional. Cross-national areas of convergence: 1. Higher pc GDP is better 2. More economic reform is better than less (Note that there is little agreement on why (1) and (2) hold. Some note that it reduces distributional conflict; others that more reform restricts the role of the state; others that reform requires compromise between labor and capital) 3. The success of the transition depends heavily on the values, interests, and capabilities of elites (Though its unclear whether this means the same thing everywhere: elites may be actual leaders, or merely summarizers of existing public will, and its not clear that they play the same role in all cases) 4. The study of democracies tends to be dominated by long-term analysis, while the study of redemocratization is dominated by short-term factors. This probably makes sense, since democratization is a process, while democracy is a thing. 5. The existence of democracy is generally seen as much more dependent on elite preferences (especially political and military leadership) than the quality of that democracy, which might depend on a much larger array of factors. 6. Parliaments are better for democracy than semiparliamentary systems, which are in turn better than presidential systems. 7. Ethnic homogeneity helps, but it's not conclusive how much, and its not conclusive how its link with nationalism helps or hurts. Nationalism can either make democratic compromises easier by providing common ground and goals, or harder by encouraging alignment of the majority against diversity and legal protection of minority interests. 8. Strong states - in the sense that the formal institutions of the state dominate or at least lead the informal institutions of society - are better. Democracy as ``uncertain results but certain procedures'', versus weak states with ``uncertain results and uncertain procedures.'' You want regular rules of the game within which to decide what the goal of the game should be. REGIONAL patterns: Generally, all democratic transitions require the same three steps: breaking with authoritarian rule, building democratic institutions, and figuring out how to get the former authoritarian elite to cooperate. But how this is done seems to have regular regional patterns. Democracy and Elites: Latin America / S. Europe: Explicit pacts between elites and masses seem to be required to stabilize uncertain situations, engage elite cooperation, and provide for political stability. Central post-socialist Europe: Pacts seem no more popular than mass protest (e.g., Poland / Hungary vs. Czech Republic / E. Germany.) Latin America / S. Europe: strategies to bridge between democracy and authoritarianism Central post-socialist Europe: strategies to explicitly reject prior regime, with no bridging strategy. (NOTE: Polish case doesn't fit...) Determining case here seems to be Desire and Capacity of opposition. Where it had Desire for change but not Capacity, it preferred strategies that kept the regime in place longer; where it had both, it was able to remove the regime immediately and replace it. Democracy and Economic Reform: Highly correlated in post-socialist economies, not so much in East Asia, Latin America. Why: 1. Link between democracy and capitalism in the electorates of post-socialist countries 2. Use of capitalism as a way for elites in post-socialist countries to trade political influence for economic wealth 3. Greater degree of nationalism in central Europe, which helped these states endure period of ``exceptional politics'' longer Threats to Democracy: 1. Rule of Law In post-socialist countries, it seems to stem from the weakness of civil society, the weakness of the state after the transition, the deeply embedded inefficiencies of Socialist economies, and the polarization of politics. In Latin American countries, in contrast, the low level of education, the continued presence of hte military in politics, economic inequality, wealth concentration in the hands of a few, and populism all seem to corrupt democracy. These factors are tied to specific regional histories. Methodological implications: -The prevalence of incomplete transitions across regions of democratic change suggests that a binary view of success may miss important elements of the transition: namely, it might be that democratic transition from dictatorship to democracy depends on tolerance of a ``hybrid'' regime. Moving too quickly in one direction may well destabilize the coalition needed to push for democratization. In this case, this would explain the common factor of incomplete reform, while preserving the tolerance of different reasons for its incompleteness. -We need to consider more about what makes ``regions'' important. If it is the specificity of regime type prior to democratic transition, then elaborating the features of those regime types might make greater generalization possible. It's not enough to stop at geographic definitions that have little to say about the political characteristics of the countries under study. },

@book{Fish2005,
	Address = {Cambridge},
	Annote = {Chs 4-8 Given Chs 1-3 and argument that the democratic transition in Russia has failed, what are the factors that have driven this failure? Fish notes three: 1. Resource Allocation 2. Incomplete Economic Modernization 3. Superpresidentialism Each is related to the other. 1. Resource allocation: This does not function in the classic sense of producing a rentier state or by funding repression or by undercutting modernization through enabling the state to be wealthy without development. Rather, the problem is the corruption that so much easily available wealth entails. This tends to produce perverse incentives for politicians to corrupt the development of the economy and the state, in order to line their own pockets with oil proceeds. Finally, the heavy dose of corruption meant that citizens would tolerate proto-authoritarianism if it promised to take on corruption (hence the support for Putin); hence the rise of a superpresidential constitution. 2. Incomplete economic modernization: by keeping the government embedded in the economy, incomplete modernization did two things: first, it prevented the kinds of changes necessary to take advantage of economic competition, firm improvement, investment, productivity gains, and so forth. Second, it gave the state levers through which to influence the economy. This encouraged corruption (see (1)) by allowing the state to use its power to extract rents from private industry, and allowed the state to use the economy in later bids to consolidate power at the center (by removing areas of competition in the private sector that were enabled by private stores of resources). 3. Superpresidentialism: the dominance of the president over the parliament, starting with the constitution in 1992, had five bad effects: 1. It meant that democracy was identified solely with the president; his failings became democracy's failings 2. It retards the development of political parties, by making Parliament a second-rate show compared to the Presidency, and thus turning it (and party competition in general) into a stepping stone to presidential competition. 3. It retards the education of politicians in how to be democrats, because there are few incentives for democratic behavior; the strength of the presidency, and the need for signs of ``leadership'' to win it, mean that it's better to be adversarial than not. Also, it tends to attract individuals to the bureaucracy - where real power lies. Thus people become bureaucrats, which is a different set of skills than one learns becoming a politician 4. Frail bureaucracies. The dependence of the bureaucracy on the president tends to make it sycophantic. With no outside political entity to turn to - like, for instance, the parliament - the bureaucracy depends on the president for promotion, funding, power, and so on. Thus it loses the ability to protect the nation from the use of state power by the president, and instead becomes merely an extension of the president's will. Furthermore, the President may have little interest in developing strong, stable, independent bureaucracies, because they could challenge his will. Thus teh state remains weak. 5. Corruption. The concentration of power at the center produces opportunities for high-ranking officials to enrich themselves. With no independent force to check the usurpation of public resources for private gain, the corruption goes unabated. Finally, objections to this pattern of events - namely, that the parliament could have done more to stop it, or that this is simply Russian culture raising its ugly head - ignore empirical evidence that contrary choices were possible in different national settings, and that different incentives - say, a different constitution that gave more power to the legislature - might have produced different legislative behavior.},

The greater number of veto points in the US, the presence of midterm elections that act as referenda on presidential policies, and a more decentralized regulatory system. The only way to explain the rise of New Right Neoliberalism is as a confluence of needs for a new set of economic management tools post-Keynesianism, and the rise of a new electoral strategy for the Right. Thus, ironically, LME economies are MORE dependent on government to set macroeconomic poilcy, because they lack other means of economic policymaking (at the sub-national or sub-governmental level) that would enable the government to step back from the economy. Furthermore, LME structures mean that firms compete on cost, not quality or other factors. Therefore, they want governments that help them compete on cost - which neoliberal, anti-union / tax / welfare state governments are uniquely positioned to address. In turn, the political parties had an interest in destroying these policies anyway, since doing so undercut the organizational bases for the opposition. (Costs of neoliberal policies were concentrated in areas considered to be safe Labour districts, so Tories didn't worry about electoral revolt) Fiscal record: 1. Tax burden was roughly the same 2. Real public spending rose, though as a ratio of NI it fell 3. Rising spending paid for by privatisation, not by increased tax revenue from economic growth 4. Lack of success fighting fiscal growth led to demand for increased power at the center. STATE Restructuring (UK): -By dismantling the bureaucracy, future governments face a much harder task if they try to re-regulate the economy -Privatization of civil service into executive agencies diminished central government control over hteir functions -Market mechanisms now dominate regulation. STATE restructuring (US) -By devolving social policy to the states, encouraged wide array of social experimentation to make up for federal deregulation -Some deregulatory aspects were found by the Supreme Court to have run afoul of the will of Congress and thus to be unconstitutional. },

	Annote = {PM powerful in Britain for 5 reasons: 1. PM appoints the executive branch 2. Majority rules in Parliament (with strong party discipline) 3. The UK state is unitary (no federalism) 4. Strong civil service is in fact loyal to the government, not the state 5. No written constitution to restrict the power of the government. The result: Thatcher could fundamentally transform the state with little opposition from the Tories and few options for resistance by Labour. However: argues that Thatcher's capitalist revival failed in the UK because it attempted to impose a model - pure laissez-faire capitalism - that could not exist. Basic ideology of the market Tories: 1. Taxes should be minimal 2. Government should be minimum, both to enable (1) and to prevent ubiquitous ``governmental failures'' 3. Production is always for profit, and should be Darwinian 4. Inequality was a necessary byproduct of the market and should not be of concern; attempts to ameliorate social inequality were antithetical to the functioning of the market. The whole of the state was redeveloped in this regard - in line with Weber's description of the capitalist state as ``one in which all decisions are matters of accountancy and everything is done in terms of balances.'' Assessment: the attempt was a failure 1. Low inflation and productivity growth have persisted 2. Income inequality rose sharply, suggesting ``trickle down'' didn't happen 3. Absolute poverty is up 4. Cost of services is up but quality is not 5. Crime rose sharply 6. Public expenditure rose alongside state power as the central government took power from municipalities 7. A ``stable currency'' policy was abandoned in 1992 8. Several severe recessions (1982, 1988) 9. No indication of shift in long-term trend of British economic growth 10. Balance of payments deficit and decline in fixed investment (therefore cutting potential long-term economic performance) 11. Little evidence that stock markets promote economic efficiency, since unlisted firms seem to do better on the long term (e.g. ``long term performance may be best when pressure to maximize short-term profits is least'') 12. While increased risk has come with increased reward, the allocation of both is uneven. Finally, the move to remake society in the ``homo economicus'' pattern has broken down other social goods. ``rational self interest'' is achieved at the cost of other social attachments. That may be at the root of the rising level of corruption in the City, the increasing dislocation of CEO pay from performance, and the disintegration of long-term Civil Service ethos due to the application of Taylorist managment. This is problematic because British culture supports these excesses, but in the past had been buffered by other aspects - notably social institutions that helped check them and had been built up since 1900. It will be difficult to rebuild these now that they have been destroyed. },

	Annote = {Argument: Thatcherism destroyed both the postwar social bargain and the older conservative bargain that might have taken its place. As a result, Britain now exists without any kind of politically stable social agreement whatsoever, a situation that can't be sustained. This destruction was enabled by the passing of monarchal power from the Monarch to Parliament and the majority party. Previously, informal agreements kept this power in check, but Thatcher (and presumably future governments) has shown no compunction in attacking this settlement. The structure of government haas enabled embedded corruption. The privatization of government has put political appointees rather than career civil servants in charge of vast budgets with little form of oversight. Utilities, service providers, and other government quangos are run by well-paid executives even as service quality declines. Press quality has declined as press consolidation has proceeded; as a result, the quality of democratic discourse has declined. Moreover, all this has come without the promised economic recovery: deregulation has made the City rich, most of the rest of hte country poor, and dramatically increased the volatility of economic performance. Full marketisation of society and government has not delivered on its promise of more general wealth. It has also not fixed the problem of chronic underinvestment in British industry (originating from preferences of the City for overseas investment.) (Critique of the City: At least in the U.S., financial investors are willing to take substantial risks in their investments, and thus volatility produces some social gains. This is not the case in the City, which remains wedded to the idea of short-term finance for Britain and capital export overseas). (Real problem of the British economy: not labor unrest, not excessive public spending, but in fact underinvestment, the one thing Thatcherism hasn't fixed. SECOND: The two threads of Thatcherism: marketization and traditional ``middle class'' society - are incompatible with each other. Sponsoring the first has destroyed the social and political grounds that promoted the second. NOTE: the ultimate problem for Hutton is the structure of the state. The institutions of the state - notably the structures of economic governance - were built around and dominated by the conservative tradition of British society. These made addressing fundamental problems - like underinvestment - impossible even under labor governments. The unwillingness to take up this problem continues to plague British governments and enabled the Thatcherite revolution. ``Non-binding corporatism and rigid statutory intervention'' Labour's mistake was thinking the problem was the economy: in fact, it was the structure of hte state.},

	Annote = {Argument: Not enough to suggest that labor organizations in CMEs are threatened by globalization. Might actually be that the kinds of competitive advantage enjoyed by CMEs are embedded in the structure of labor markets, and that this constrains the exit options of firms within those markets. Adjustment depends heavily on plant-level cooperation between labor and capital. Thus different logics of adjustment: LME: lack of strong bargaining institutions for firms to work with means that they benefit from deregulating regulations with labor (e.g., atomizing labor). CME: existence of strong, credible bargaining institutions encourages adjustment through concertation. Decentralization / deregulation of labor bargaining may be harmful to firms given their competitive strategies. Thus should not expect the same kind of adjustment in both economies. In fact, globalization might drive divergence. In CMEs: Germany: preference for shop-floor stability has conflicted with Mittelstand's dissatisfaction with having to bear higher costs in wage bargaining. But so far, no exit from the ``pattern bargaining'' setup has occurred. Biggest risk is not labor, but in fact the disintegration of employers associations Sweden: Firm exposure to JIT / Lean Production methods mean shop floor disruption is very costly to firms. Hence willingness to exist within standing structures, and to negotiate new agreements on how wage bargaining will work that strengthen corporatist institutions. Italy: Ideological, rather than sectoral, divisions in unions have kept union unity high (whereas sectoral or craft division might have caused fracturing when sectoral adjustment or skill-based adjustment became asymmetric.) Unity of unions provided for better plant-level negotiation and, in turn, better national-level ``tripartism'' for reforming standing labor market laws in the 1990s amid governmental turmoil following mani pulite. In LMEs: United States: Firms have moved towards plant-level negotiation wtih labor, trying to undercut sectoral unions like UAW on the grounds that they need plant-level flexibility. Firm strategies are grounded in short-term horizons for profitability management. Britain: Thatcherite reforms made strike action very difficult. Craft unions are also on the decline; instead, employers cut bargains wtih single unions to allow representation in exchange for various ways of protecting against strikes and labor unrest. National-level bargaining has been under attack.},

Denmark is also a case of dramatic transformation of an economic system, from near-failure in the early 1990s to outstanding success in 2006. Moreover, this has come as Denmark has integrated ever-more-tightly into the global economy. Argument: that early Danish developments (19th, early 20th century) laid a groundwork for socioeconomic adjustment that could be called upon when adjustment in the late 20th century. Thus Katzenstein's argument: the experience of being a small state means the experience of being vulnerable to outside changes - economic, strategic, and political. That experience means that these states view the world in a fundamentally different way, and develop national strategies for defense against these changes. Corporatism is the most obvious: you accept international economic openness to avoid retaliation by much larger states, and in exchange for accepting this you build structures to negotiate on a societal basis the allocation of the rewards and risks implicit in accepting international economic openness. Historic Bases of Danish Economic Adjustment: 1. Strong, competent state apparatus developed in 17th-18th centuries under the absolutist government to administer the Danish empire. 2. Vulnerability implicit in having lost substantial territory to Germany in 1860s resulted in three things: -Ethnic homogeneity -Strong national identity based on cross-class solidarity, individual liberty, education, and civil society -Fear of national destruction developed both nationalism and cross-class consensus about need to preserve Danish independence, leading to class reconciliation -Class reconciliation generated set of bargaining institutions that could be called on for resolving a wide spectrum of conflict -Small economy drove need for trade; link to Britain on trade integrated Denmark into global economy -Early land reform (18th century) removed one point of contention More proximate conditions: -Existence of highly organized social-economic groups that can negotiate with each other -Blend of social democracy and classical liberalism -Necessity of coalition government -NOT a society without social conflict: but a society in which that social conflict took place on a foundation of broad agreement on basic issues (e.g., threat of outside vulnerability) and amid basic agreement on need for concertation -Deference to concertation shown by Constitutional Court, such that bargaining partners could trust that settlements would hold even if at edges of constitutional acceptance. Why has this system persevered compared with other systems of social bargaining? -Consultation with business about outcomes -Employers' associations as allies, that took initiative in bringing firms into bargaining process PROBLEMS: 1. EU pressure on macroeconomic policy, that hems in the range of possible bargains for social partners 2. Tendency for EU politics to work by referendum rather than concertation 3. Concerns over loss of sovereignty excite the nationalist aspect of the Danish political bargain 4. Immigration not well-tolerated by the system (see, for instance, Alesina study on diversity and welfare) LESSONS: 1. Small states that were once large have different politics than merely small states (NOTE: Why is Austria different in this regard? Very different set of social outcomes despite having been large? Due to multicultural structure of empire? But loss of empire produced ethnic homogeneity) 2. Globalization doesn't kill of corporatism - in fact, corporatism in small states may make state more competitive 3. Time frame of bargains is important. Contra VoC literature, Corporatist states allow for longer-term bargaining that may be conducive to social stability 4. VoC assumes equilibrium - but the Danish case suggests continuous adjustment rather than convergence on equilibrium. },

@article{Levy1999a,
	Annote = {Question: how does the reform of Christian Democratic welfare states work? Do the welfare state institutions make reform difficult, or do their failings provide focal points for reform? Three cases: 1. French case: reforming welfare state failings provides resources to buy off left-wing constituents without increasing social spending on the whole. 2. Italian case: reforming welfare state failings by attacking their inequities provides political cover for reforms necessary to reduce budget deficits 3. Dutch case: intensification of concertation and social protection structures allows for improved economic competitiveness. Argument is CONTRA Esping-Andersen: Andersen argues that Christian Democratic systems generate ``self-reinforcing negative spirals'' by creating unemployment, which then must be compensated, which requires raising taxes, which then creates more unemployment, and so forth. How, then, to explain that center-left leaders in these states have been able to reform welfare systems? Answer: the inefficiencies within the CD welfare state regimes provide focal points where reforms can generate gains that can be used to increase economic competitiveness, compensate losers from the reforms, or achieve other structural reforms. Furthermore, because the CD structures emanate from the Right, they tend to produce certain kinds of inequities that the Center-Left is well-positioned to take on. (QUESTION: This process isn't always very efficient. Little evidence in the French case that this paid off. For instance, Jospin's restoration of universal family benefits was paid for by raising the taxes on those to whom benefits were restored. This is convoluted. Is this really reform?) Thus this is useful to ``progressive'' politicians but not necessarily to the political economy as a whole. QUESTION: Is the timing on the Italian case right? Need to account for start of reforms in the 1988 time period. See James Walsh, ``Political Bases of Macroeconomic Adjustment: Evidence from the Italian Experience.'' The ``tying hands'' argument for reform (namely, that EMU membership in 1992 drove adjustment), seems not to hold. QUESTION: Netherlands model of reform depended on, if I recall, secret deals between Lubbers and the social partners. Is this kind of dealing good for democratic politics? How durable is the settlement? Nevertheless: compared to the Right, the Left has been more successful at welfare reform in Europe. Why? Because it has viewed the inefficiencies of CD-style states as opportunities to both reduce this inefficiency and construct new programs that accomplish other social ends while improving economic flexibility. In contrast, the Right has been short-lived in its successes because of attempts to indiscriminately cut benefits. },

	Annote = {Problems: 1. ``Meditteranean'' and ``Continental'' welfare models are bad for economic efficiency regardless whether they deliver more equity; compared to the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic models, they are less useful for modern competition. 2. Failures of the Med and Continental economies to perform are tied to the welfare state; but are often projected onto the European project and thus undercut it even as its completion becomes more important. What are these models: 1. Anglo-Saxon: low rates of social protection designed to handle ``last resort'' cases 2. Nordic: low labor market intervention but high rates of social protection for those who lose their jobs, embedded in a framework that encourages finding of new jobs and worker retraining. 3. Continental: insurance-based pension and unemployment with strong legal protections against job loss 4. Med: High rates of old-age pension spending Problems, contd: 3. Sustainability of Europe, European economies dependent on finding a way to deliver both equity and efficiency. Only hte Nordic model does that. 4. The organization of EU politics makes determining where competence lies for solving the various European economic problems difficult. The EU has not helped itself by confusing this issue. Thus voters tend to blame the EU (and domestic politicians are tempted to encourage them to do so) even when the EU is not at fault. },

@inbook{Thelen1999,
	Address = {Cambridge},
	Annote = {Short answer: because the structure of German production (high-everything) depends on reliable shop floor relations. The German system, by separating wage bargaining from working conditions negotiations, keeps contentious wage bargaining relations off the German shop floor and provides predictability for German firms. These benefits are worth a lot, enough that, despite declining German union membership, the German employers are reluctant to dismantle the system. Thus, two problems: first, there are internal cleavages within German employers about whether the traditional bargaining system is still useful (large employers say yes, the Mittelstand is less certain) and uncertainty about what an alternative system would look like. Other developments: 1. The biggest problem in wage bargaining isn't the union - it's the employers' association. Smaller firms are concerned that they will not have the flexibility they would like within the sectoral wage contracts and are therefore trying to defect. If too many defect, the union will begin to doubt the durability of wage bargains. 2. Desire to devolve wage bargaining to works councils (to achieve flexibility) conflicts with desire for shop floor peace, because giving works councils too much wage bargaining authority would destroy the conditions that allow works councils to function effectively in their working conditions bargaining role. 3. Through a series of strikes in the early-to-mid 1990s, the Gesamtmetall employers association attempted to take hard-line positions against the unions, only to find that its major sponsors - large German firms like BMW - were unwilling to sponsor those positions. Meanwhile, the Mittelstand grew increasingly upset with this unwillingness, but could not figure out a way to escape the system. No ready-made / prexisting alternative organization for wage bargaining. (Is this a function of the legal system? Why no analog to the SIA vs. Electronics IA?) 4. Employers do not gain bargaining power in a high-U environment. Dependence on highly skilled workers with firm-specific knowledge means they can't replace recalcitrant workers with unemployed. 5. Abandoning Gesamtmetall would destroy the wage bargaining arrangements implicit in it. Thus even the Mittelstand fears what would come of such a move. NET: The effect of globalization on German wage bargaining is counterintuitive. The dependence of German firms on high-skilled labor with specific knowledge reduces their bargaining power over workers, even in periods of high unemployment. It also removes their exit option through outsourcing, since such workers can't be found elsewhere. Finally, dependence on shop floor relations to keep production moving gives added leverage to union and keeps otherwise disgruntled employers inside the wage bargaining system.},

@techreport{Gilson2003,
	Abstract = {Twenty years ago we published a paper, ``The Mechanisms of Market Efficiency,'' that sought to describe the institutional underpinnings of price formation in the securities market. Since that time, financial economics has moved forward on many fronts. The sub-discipline of behavioral finance has struggled to bring yet more descriptive realism to the study of financial markets. Two important questions are (1) how much has this new discipline changed our understanding of the efficiency and nature of the institutional mechanisms that set price in financial markets; and (2) how far does this discipline carry novel implications for the regulation of financial markets or corporate behavior more generally? We argue that, despite its heavy reliance on the psychology of cognitive bias, the principal contribution of behavioral finance is to enrich our understanding of market institutions rather than to present us with a fundamentally new paradigm of market behavior. In particular, the cognitive limitations of individual investors or noise traders are likely to matter to pricing behavior to the extent that they interact with - and are not offset by - the arbitrage mechanism in the market. The most important contribution of behavioral finance lies in sharpening our understanding of the limitations of the arbitrage mechanism. Even when cognitive bias does not have clear implications for securities prices, however, it may have important implications for policy. These implications are unlikely to arise in the area of corporate takeovers, as some have claimed, but they do arise in areas akin to consumer protection, as where cognitive bias might lead unsophisticated investors to construct dangerously undiversified retirement portfolios. },

Rather, each society should conceive of democracy as a way of pursuing some (society-defined) goal of a just society. Basically, comes down to two things: first, the inability to define hard limits to politics; thus it is hard to say, a priori, that anything is off limits. Second, that conflict in society over social outcomes is inevitable, and that democracy is probably the best way to resolve them (since other things like hierarchy and such, are ultimately bad). Hence democracy isn't purely procedural - but it's not purely substantive, either. Rather, it's in between, process in pursuit of better substance. },

Compared to the ``ancients'', we want more democracy under less opportune conditions (conflict with Constant?) 2. Ever-more-complex society demands that we have more experts, but expertise is inherently undemocratic. Moreover, as the franchise expands (more democracy) the demands on the state expand (more bureaucracy). This doesn't make it bad, but it does mean that as we become a more advanced society, we face a choice: to become more technocratic, or to yield more complex decisions to less-well-informed people on the grounds of democracy 3. Technological advance has the same effect as (2). 4. Democracy depends on an open mass society, but mass society seems to converge on cultural and political ``industries'' that inform against hte individual agent. Alternate models: It is difficult to conceive of other models that attempt to guarantee the kind of rights-based framework that democracy (particularly liberal democracy) does. Calls for achievement of some kind of socialist democracy via revolution and dictatorship are misguided: democracy cannot be had via dictatorship, which often proves permanent rather than transitory and oppressive rather than liberal. Direct democracy (as with Constant) is obtainable only in the case of small polities. Finally, the one feature of liberal market democracy of detriment to the last is the diminished sovereignty of the people in the realm of economic decisionmaking, which is removed from the domain of politics. },

O'Donnell assumes that the rule of law in society will form a virtuous cycle. However, if in LA the elite movements in politics skew the law toward the wealthy and powerful, that will not occur. Since so much of LA politics is captive to elites already, it seems doubtful that legal reform will open the regime and the rights system up to the poor elements in society.

	Annote = {22 Propositions on the relationship of human rights, human development, and democracy: 1. Human development and human rights share the concept of the human being as an agent 2. The question thus becomes what circumstances constitute basic conditions for human agency 3. Democracy is not only fair and institutionalized elections, but also a ``wager'' - the acceptance of each individual of the political participation of every other individual, independent of whether a given individual thinks certain others should have the vote or the participatory rights 4. Democracy is not merely voting, but also specifically political freedeoms, which are necessary for free and fair elections 5. The boundaries of these political freedoms are undecidable, and so a minimum set of sufficient rights cannot be defined. 6. Political citizenship is the assignment of these universal rights to political participation (including voting and being elected) and the rights that guarantee the persistence of voting and election 7. A democratic regime presupposes (a) the territorial integrity of the state, thus delimiting which individuals are participants, and (b) a legal system within that territory that assigns political citizenship on a universal basis 8. The evolution of the West embedded the idea of individual autonomy in the social, economic, and cultural realms well before democracy came into being and universalistic citizenship became a reality. The rise of capitalism and democracy, and the legal doctrines that supported them, furthered the idea of individual agency and legal accountability. 9. As in T.H. Marshall, the evolution of democracy saw the evolution of the definition of the sphere of political rights. 10. The link between the full exercise of poltiical rights and hte problems of ability (in other words, limits on agency) was addressed through the elaboration of civil and social rights. 11. Therefore agency has implications in the political, civil, and social spheres simultaneously, and cannot be dissociated from any of them. 12. Democracy has five unique characteristics: free and fair elections, participatory political rights, the wager of universality, a legal system backing the rights and conditions of the wager, and a legal system holding the elected to account for the laws. 13. The execution of democracy is dependent on the link between the political system and a state that acts to the same purposes and outcomes 14. These state institutions have the responsibility to administer the laws without regard for any characteristics other than the individual's agency 15. Power corrupts, however, and most often to the disadvantage of the rights of the poor 16. The effectiveness of political rights depends on diverse sources of non-state-sanctioned information 17. The social context of such an open-information-society, plus the exercise of political rights, represents a nurturing context for the development of democratic agency. 18. Latin America did not develop rights in the same sequence as Marshall described for the West. Political rights typically came first, followed by (or, in many cases, not) by civil and social rights. This has profound implications for political development. 19.These countries also have ineffective or unevenly effective legal systems that are poor enforcers of the enumerated rights 20. The scope of rights is legitimately disputed 21. The reason for the legitimacy of this dispute is tied to both external constraints (economic, international) and internal diversity (as a function of agency in a social context) },

	Annote = {Argument: Contra neoliberal theories, industrial policy is more relevant than ever to the successful development of emerging markets. What's changed is the content of that IP and the demands it places on governments. Recognizing this has led to a convergence between economic theories focusing on market failures needing government solutions, and those focusing on market efficiencies from which government should abstain. Argument: First, that IP is about figuring out where market failures present barriers to effective development, and then using policy to resolve them. These failures are NOT located primarily in industry. Second, that IP now is NOT about picking winners; in fact, emerging markets in global economies often find their competitive advantage by experimentation. Thus the real goal is to encourage not industrial concentration but industrial experimentation, such that the search for competitive advantage proceeds apace. Third, that mistakes are NOT bad. What is bad is not recognizing them and escaping from them. Bureaucracies should not be punished for mistakes, but should be punished for entrenching those mistakes. Fourth, that the ultimate problem of industrial innovation in emerging markets is entrepreneurship - demand for innovation - because of the high risk of entrepreneurial activity amidst significant uncertainty that cannot be accommodated by markets. Substance: Entrepreneurship is about cost discovery. Emerging markets can now find niches in which to specialize in the global economy in ways not possible 20 years ago. Those niches involve cost competitiveness. But where such competitiveness exists is not obvious. Thus entrepreneurship is about looking for it, which is inherently risky. Furthermore, unlike other kinds of discovery, you can't protect it: once you figure out where your economy is cost competitive, everyone can move to that sector. So there's a market failure in awarding the cost discovery process. Entrepreneurship must be supported by infrastructure - but keep in mind that ``support'' and ``subsidy'' are not the same. Presumably, if the industry is competitive in international markets, the infrastructure should eventually pay for itself. Thus what's needed is early insurance against entrepreneurial risk, not long-term subsidy. In fact, the subsidy can and will distort the market if incorrectly applied. Cannot specify the institutional structure needed to pull this off. Rather, can describe the continuum of possibilities for hte bureaucracy. Similar to Breznitz, there's a tension between autonomy and embeddedness: or, rather, between the problem of information completeness versus the problem of corruption. How to balance this tension varies with the economic and institutional environment you operate in. Better to have second-best policies administered by competent bureaucracies than first-best ones administered by corrupt or inefficient bureaucracies. Thus don't worry too much about the specific ministry that does the policy - worry about which is the most competent, and design your policies around its competency. Principles: 1. Provide incentives only to ``new'' activities 2. Establish clear benchmarks for success, and use them ruthlessly to avoid entrenching failure 3. Build in sunset clauses to prevent long-term market distortion 4. Target activities, not sectors. It's where the market failures occur and avoids the necessity of picking winners. 5. Subsidize activities with spillover effects. Remember, diversity is the goal. 6. Vest authority in competent agencies even if they aren't necessarily the ``right'' ones. 7. Agency leadership and their bosses must have both clear authority and clear accountability 8. IP agencies must be in communication with the private sector 9. Mistakes aren't bad. 10. Renewal and discovery needs to occur within the administrative agency as well as within industry. Do international regimes restrict IP? No - little of what's discussed here violates the IP, trade, or finance rules lodged in the WTO or other arrangements. The most harmful are explicit export subsidies, since exporting industries are known to develop faster and with better efficiency and technology than non-exporting ones. TRIPS is another. },

	Annote = {Case study of the national strategies of IT competitiveness in Taiwan, Ireland, and Israel, founded on a basic question: all three states became hypercompetitive in international IT markets within one generation, but did so with very different success rates in different sectors. How to explain this? Supposition: that increased globalization in an increasingly complex economy gives states more, not less, flexibility in choosing national industrial policy. Because production chains are now disaggregated, states can try to enter them at a wider variety of points than ever before. However, there are caveats: unlike Gerschenkronian development, states cannot poach technology in the same way, given the pace of technological change. Rather, states need to make specific arrangements to bring technology in from outside and merge it with internally-developed technology. Modes of development: Taiwan: development of the pure-play IC foundry, insertion in the global production system of IC products Ireland: development of software and services, with little hardware, and heavy use of MNC and EU funds and assistance. Israel: success at niche hardware and software through explicit government sponsorship of R\&D Two theoretical problems: 1. How do states shape the development of cutting-edge industries like IT, where conventional wisdom holds that it is impossible to ``pick winners''? 2. Why did multiple different development pathways emerge? Problems with the Gerschenkronian view: 1. The markets these states entered were not already well-developed; therefore not merely a matter of marshalling resources to invest in known technology. 2. Catch-up is an oxymoron in an industry that is about the creation and application of new technology 3. Success models are diverse: none of these three states has bureaucracies, governments, or industries that look at all like each other. Conclusion: state-industry embeddedness in pursuit of rapid development is not a binary embedded / not embedded question. Rather, how and where the state embeds itself in the economy is critical to understanding the successes of the national development pathway. Thus, developmental bureaucracy NOT Weberian: not heavily insulated from industry. Rather, by choosing the way it is embedded with industry, it is choosing how it will both gain information from rapidly changing industrial conditions and then use that information to shape responses. Global production fragmentation: With production fragmenting by stage, it becomes possible to pick a stage to specialize in, aggregate the demand of different industries and companies in that stage, and gain economies of scale and thus competitive advantage. Terms this ``Production Stage Specialization'' Decisive factors in achieving this: 1. Relation of industry to global markets - in particular, the MNCs that ultimately design and source products 2. The development of specific capabilities for specific activities that are suitable to specific stages of production (Note: by inference, deciding on a specific stage of production has consequences for the demands placed on the state) Relation to MNCs is critical: depends on what portion of the production chain the MNC has outsourced to you: R\&D, intermediary design, intermediary assembly, etc. The demands of the various stages radically influence the set of skills and institutions you need to excel at that stage. New Model of State Industrial Policy: NOT ``picker of winners'' but instead facilitation for firms to ``make long-term commitments to operate in rapid innovation based industries and activities.'' Tension in this role: Between having enough information to play the role of facilitator / organizer, and not asserting all the power that would come with having such information to the extent that it imposes rigidities on the sector. LOTS of ways to do this: Taiwan: closed state, closed industry, but porous state-sponsored R\&D Israel: porous state and porous industry (lots of cross-population of experts and CEOs), linked through industrial development agencies Ireland: Closed state, porous industry, linked by porous development agencies. Key to recognize that this means changed functions for the state: Old state model: (1) facilitate deals for tech transfer with MNCs; (2) use control over the currency to shape industrial development through finance; (3) prevent MNCs from becoming too dominant at home and driving out local firms. New state model: Engage MNCs and global financial markets in different ways for specific sectoral purposes; develop indigenous R\&D rather than relying on tech transfer. Hence range of possibilities, from relying on MNC technology and becoming experts in production methods to relying on indigenous R\&D and becoming R\&D suppliers.},

It is the process of interpreting codified knowledge in the context of tacit knowledge in order to tie generalized experience and information to a specific problem. The ability to do this within a firm presents the possibility for responding rapidly to changing demands from external clients. Technology allows the increased codification of knowledge.

Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that the degree to which the dominant ethnic tradition or culture is institutionalized in the laws and policies of a nation-state affects citizen tolerance of ethnic minorities. Employing a multilevel regression model, it systematically tests the framework, as well as competing individual and country-level explanations, for all member states of the European Union in 1997. Results confirm a strong relationship between the laws governing the acquisition and expression of citizenship, that is, citizenship regime type, and individual tolerance judgments. Moreover, citizenship regime type has a strong mediating effect on three individual-level variables previously shown to predict tolerance: ingroup national identity, political ideology, and satisfaction with democracy. },

Weldon sees citizenship law as a potential means of institutionalizing the dominant ethnic tradition or culture.

Collectivist - ethnic (jus sanguinis citizenship laws) - not accepting unless groups are linked by birthright 2. Republican / assimilationist - accepting to the extent that new groups can adopt the characteristics of the dominant culture 3. individualist - civic (multicultural / no assimilation) - ``state'' more important than ``nation'' - the nation is viewed not as a collection of groups but as one of individuals with a right to unique belief structures. Three hypotheses: 1. Collectivist-ethnic groups will show low levels of both soial and political tolerance 2. Republican states will show political tolerance but not social tolerance 3. Individualist states will show both. Confirmed by analysis of a Eurobarometer survey across Europe measuring both social and political tolerance.

	Abstract = {Mainstream comparative research on political institutions focuses primarily on formal rules. Yet in many contexts, informal insti- tutions, ranging from bureaucratic and legislative norms to clientelism and patrimonialism, shape even more strongly political behavior and outcomes. Scholars who fail to consider these informal rules of the game risk missing many of the most important incentives and constraints that underlie political behavior. In this article we develop a framework for studying informal institutions and integrating them into comparative institutional analysis. The framework is based on a typology of four patterns of formal- informal institutional interaction: complementary, accommodating, competing, and substitutive. We then explore two issues largely ignored in the literature on this subject: the reasons and mechanisms behind the emergence of informal institutions, and the nature of their stability and change. Finally, we consider challenges in research on informal institutions, including issues of identification, measurement, and comparison. },

Pursuit of goals not considered publically acceptably and therefore goals that can't be embodied in formal institutions Process of creation: attention should be paid to the process of creation using the same method of analysis as for formal institutions: whose interests are served? how are those interests conceived? What deals were made between interest groups in order to found a particular set of rules? Three research questions: First, what are the actors' shared expectations about the actual constraints they face? Second, what is the commu- nity to which the informal rules apply? Third, how are informal rules enforced? },

	Abstract = {Many people consider voting the most important form of political participation in a democracy. To this point, no aggregate-level, cross-national studies have been done on the factors that affect voter turnout in Africa. This article seeks to fill the gap in the literature by examining the factors that influence voter turnout in sub-Saharan Africa's multiparty regimes that have had two consecutive elec- tions since the democratic transitions in the 1990s. Many of the central findings of the research on voter turnout in other regions reappear in the examination of voter turnout in Africa. The authors find that two institutional variables---type of electoral formula and concurrency of presidential and legislative elections--- have significant effects on electoral turnout. Media exposure has a significant positive relationship with voter turnout. The number of elections a polity has had also appears to affect levels of voter turnout.},
	Annote = {Controlling for other factors - economic development, racial diversity, etc - the authors find that voters in Africa respond to institutional factors in ways similar to voters in other regions. Hence evidence suggests that voting behavior is similar across regions and that there is nothing unique in African voting behavior. Another way of asking the question: will Africa's very different informal institutions make voter behavior much different from other regions? Method: Look at voter turnout as a \% of registered voters in legislative elections. Institutional variables: party diversity; majoritarian vs. proportional representation; bicameral vs. unicameral Control variables: level of democracy (FH scores); time since democratization; presidential power; socioeconomic variables (urbanization, pc income, pc income growth); media coverage. Results: 1. Institutional design matters along the following lines: -Simultaneous elections matter -Majoritarian systems have lower turnout -Multiparty systems appear not to matter -Previous experience in elections (e.g., longer time since democratization) does matter 2.Net: First, African's arent' different; second, they respond in ways we'd expect from observing other democracies; third, thre is a time lag in institutional effectiveness. },

	Annote = {Question: how to explain the political instability of the developing world? Hypothesis: Economic development produces rapid social change and social modernization that destabilizes more slowly developing political institutions. ``If men are to remain civilized or to become so, the art of associating must grow and improve in the same ration in which the equality of conditions is increased.'' Causal mechanism: social and economic change produce rising political consciousness and extend political demands; but the institutions to manage these demands are underdeveloped. The mismatch between political mobilization and political effectiveness creates political instability. Effect on development policy in the postwar era: Americans tend to assume that economic change produces political stability; but they don't provide a way to manage that change, and so end up producing instability. In contrast, the communists provide a way of managing the political gap - even if their economic proposals are less useful. Hence their attractiveness. Role of political institutions: they facilitate the ``coming together'' of disparate social groups and channel competition or disagreement between these groups into a bargaining process. Measurement of institutionalization: four factors: adaptability, complexity, autonomy, and coherence Adaptability: can the institution change in response to changing external conditions, or is it designed for only one set of circumstances? Complexity: how many purposes does an institution serve? Those that serve many - or interlinked - purposes are both more likely to survive and more indicative of a complex society with a high level of institutionalization. Moreover, these more complex institutions are, in turn, likely to be more adaptable to changing circumstances. Autonomy: Institutions should not be captured by one social group or set of social groups. Rather, they need to function as a way of managing social tensions generally. To the extent that they are not autonomous, they will tend to be less adaptable / more likely to lose their ability to manage conflict as the environment changes. Also - if politics is not autonomous, it enables groups that have captured institutions to play at politics without being identified as doing so, since they can play through the institutions they manage. Hence the institution is failing at the crucial role of bringing social groups into the political system where they are forced to associate with each other. Coherence: What are the boundaries of an institution's authority or function? How well-structured is it to resolve conflicts within these boundaries? POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERESTS Argues that ``the public interest'' does not exist without institutions, since there is no entity with a long enough time horizon to conceive of the public interest, and there is no place where various private interests can converge. But an autonomous institution can have a sufficiently long time horizon to conceive of a public interest and implement it. MODERNIZATION AND DECAY Social mobilization + economic development tend to upset institutions. These changes occur faster than the institution can adapt to them. As a result, it becomes difficult to (1) manage conflict between groups and (2) conceive of a public interest beyond the various factional interests. Moreover, many early institutions - tribes, villages, religions - are incapable of managing the kind of complex society produced by economic modernization. The failure of old institutions before new ones are created tends to produce ``alienation and anomie, normlessness generated by the conflict of old and new values...before new skills, motivations, and resources can be brought into existence'' to create new ones. As a result, people tend to look to older, possibly obsolete groupings to anchor their lives. ``Modernity breeds stability, but modernization breeds instability.'' Factors to consider: breakdown of old social groups; rising income inequality; increases in mobility, diluting social ties; distributional conflicts; rising education and literacy, enabling better communication and knowledge; better capacity for group organization; rising middle class with demands on political power. Economic growth may pacify these trends for awhile; but economic downturn tends to exacerbate them and cause revolution.},

	Annote = {Question: global capitalism failed once when at the height of its transnational integration. It could do so again. What do we need to learn from the first failure in order to forestall the second? 1. Global capitalism failed the first time because its major distinguishing features - the gold standard chief among them - were too rigid to permit national adjustment to the problems of the first part of the 20th century. This was mostly true in the prewar period. In the interwar period, it was especially true - because of the rise of highly democratic systems. The Gold Standard required deflation as a way of restoring balance; deflation is relatively easy to tolerate if you can ignore the populace, but much harder if you cannot. Hence the problems of hte interwar years, when the franchise was radically extended. (Note that the Economist Review on ``The Titans'' suggests that deflation isn't so bad...if originating from technological change and not monetary policy. But how does that account for the 1873-96 period, when rising ag prod and falling demand costs created what was known as the ``Great Depression?'' Remember, viz Keynes, that both deflation and inflation have income-redistributional effects. 2. The solution to this was embodied in three major settlements - security, economic, and social/political - that permitted flexibility within a system of macroeconomic stability. Doing so was made possible by the critical link between security and economics in the Cold War, which led the U.S. to make certain compromises on principle in order to achieve good outcomes. 3. As the security-economics link fails, and the hegemonic role of the U.S. fades, how to manage the adjustment? Lessons: 1. Ignoring the costs and tensions of globalization at the national level, in particular those experienced by its losers, will be fatal to the enterprise. Likewise, ignoring the benefits of globalization will also be fatal. The faiure to do both was at the root of the failure of the interwar economy and the inability to reconstruct a stable macroeconomic order. 2. Market forces will not solve all needs. But neither will autarky. 3. Institutions are needed to help manage adjustment Signs of emerging macroeconomic tensions: 1. Rising income inequality in the United States, despite continued good economic performance 2. Growing dependence of the main world economy on imported capital, with unpredictable effects on macroeconomic adjustment 3. The end of a significant national security reason for the US to pursue open international markets (unlike in the Cold War) - which formed the basis for the bipartisan commitment to open markets (which brought in protectionist republicans via their Cold War credentials, and the more liberal free-traders despite their ambiguous commitment to the Cold War). In fact, now you might notice tensions between security and economics - as with the economic dependence on Chinese capital despite potential security problems. },

	Annote = {Argument: standard theories for European integration (esp functionalism) cannot explain why the SEA / move to Maastricht appeared when and how it did. To do so, you must look to the changing international political and economic environment to understand how the policy space available to Europe changed in the 1970s and early 1980s, in ways that made policy entrepreneurship possible on the part of the Commission. Other possible arguments: 1. Functionalism assumes integration has an interior logic. But that doesn't explain why integration has been so staccato. It also doesn't account for why, in areas where the EC had no competency, national solutions continued to obtain (esp. security). 2. Domestic politics doesn't explain where the policy leadership came from. It does help to explain why such leadership could be followed. What changed: 1. The U.S. declined in relative terms in the world economy and so lost some of its hegemonic control 2. Japan emerged as a serious economic challenger to the developed economies of Europe and N. America 3. Technological evolution changed the nature of transatlantic ties; technological trade had been closely tied to security - but with Japan's rise, Europe faced technological dependency outside the security framework. 4. The dollar-based system switched from one of design to one of choice, with a commensurate decline in US market power What could Europe have chosen: 1. National responses 2. A switch from close ties to the US to close ties with Japan 3. European integration as a means of changing the terms on which Europe participated in global markets. (3) was chosen. Why? 1. Economic changes. Failure of national political-economic models in the 1970s opened the possibility of seeking an extra-national solution. 2. Demise or change in Leftist politics by 1983 eliminated a major political opponent to European integration. In other words, governmental coalitions shifted away from anti-market forces to pro-market forces (sometimes unexpectedly) who saw the common market as a way of achieving national prerogatives. 3. Demise in corporatism across Europe meant extra-national bargains became more possible. 4. Deregulation - whether under Thatcher or Mitterand - allowed previously incompatable coalitions to emerge. Amidst 1-4, the Commission under Delors was able to be a policy entrepreneur via very savvy moves to time and date the march towards a common market in 1992. In this context, it found support from powerful European MNCs. Thus you had convergence across three powerful policy actors: national governments, the Commission, and the Corporation. Question: will the logic of 1992 continue to drive a set of bargains that will be important to the functioning of the market but were not in Delors' ``300 points?'' 1. Emergence of a common monetary policy and integrated capital markets 2. A method of dealing with welfare state policy that prevents national competiton on the basis of the institutional structure of the welfare state, but does not require harmonization of standards. 3.

	Annote = {Question: why did the EU coalesce around a model of mutual recognition for the internal market, given that there were several other possible and efficient solutions available? Cannot be explained by functionalist ideas because of the possibility of multiple equilibria; cannot be explained by standard models of cooperation for mutual gain, since it's not clear why all actors would converge on the same option for cooperation. Argument: in an environment where cooperation would produce gains but information asymmetry between actors is high, ideas can play a critical role in constructing ``focal points'' around which different actors can all converge. In the case of the Common Market, the idea was the decision endorsing ``Mutual Recognition'' in the EU, in the Cassis de Dijon ruling of ECJ. By finding mutual recognition to be required by the Treaty of Rome, the ECJ both (1) embedded the idea in the larger European project, thereby making exit harder, and (2) injected an idea for how to run the common market in an environment where there were already interests supported the common market in principle. Thus Cassis de Dijon gave impetus to a political settlement that hte actors might not have been able to reach on their own, given the lack of complete transparency between them. Note however: there are limits to the range of ideas that work in this context. The ECJ has limited enforcement mechanisms and therefore must be careful to ground its rulings in prevailing political winds. If it pushes too hard on sensitive issues, the member state governments can push back, up to and including revising the Treaty of Rome. Thus the ECJ works as a source of idea ``focal points'' only when it operates within the prevailing political winds.},

	Annote = {Argument: that Asia is converging on a regionalist economy, but one that is (1) not constituted as a more peaceful version of the Japan-centric ``Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere'' and (2) not a closed model. Brief historical sketch: For both economic and political reasons, Japan quickly became the largest foreign aid and FDI source for Asia after WWII. This was both because of the need to pay reparations, and as a way of building market access. Early on, this model of relations with its neighbors developed into a ``flying goose'' model where the less-developed neighbors were expected to adopt mfg of products after Japan had moved up the value chain. Thus Japan would be the leader, SE Asia the followers. Where this would go depended on internal Japanese politics. Right-wing nationalism saw paternal relations with Asia as a way of reasserting Japan's honor and prestige after WWII; left-wing socialism preferred neutrality and a severing of ties with the international capitalist economy. What won out was a more centrist idea of Japanese politics. In turn, this meant close ties with the U.S., and peripheral ties with Asia. Economic relations were structured to import raw materials from Asia and export finished goods to the U.S. Moves away from this model came with the successful reindustrialization of Japan and the end of Bretton Woods. Japanese firms with capital to spare turned to FDI in Asia as a way of establishing lower-cost supply chains. FDI also helped get around problems of currency appreciation, by producing directly for markets. In time, Japanese FDI became the major source of foreign investment, ahead even of the U.S. As such, the second period of postwar history sees Japan becoming ``more Asian.'' Nevertheless, it remained closely linked - in security, economics, and politics - to the U.S. But this greater ``Asianism'' within Japan was not comprehensive. What happened in economics did not happen in culture - and so Japan's influence on Asia compared with the U.S. remained checked, because of U.S. cultural dominance. Thus by the end of the 20th century, Asia has economic regionalism embedded in economic transnationalism. Japan sits atop a structure of production where raw materials and intermediates are fed to it from Asia, and manufactures go to the developed world. This portends a future of ``internationalist'' regionalism. (NOTE - why? Because Japan lacked the ability to pull off the cultural / political reconciliation that made the EU possible...)},

	Annote = {Argument: the conditions necessary for lasting democracy are the same as those for the security of property and contract rights at the heart of economic growth. Note that autocrats and their subjects can be construed as rational actors. It is rational, if you live in a time of great uncertainty, to tolerate the autocrat's demands for taxation in exchange for physical security. Likewise, if you are an autocrat, it is rational to limit your demands for taxation to some optimum but not confiscatory level, lest your subjects grow weary and find another autocrat. However, this optimum is probably above the level at which sustained economic growth becomes possible. This is because the autocrat, knowing the violence of the transition of power, has good reason to amass wealth for a day when he must flee, or to spend it now since he'll be killed eventually. He thus has an incentive to provide public goods (security) and to extract the maximum amount for himself (rent-seeking). In democracies, the level of tolerance is lower. Why? Because property rights give the ultimate rulers an interest in their private incomes. Since taxation, taken to the level of monopoly rent, reduces the private income, the majority is less likely to tax itself at that level. (NOTE: Olson seems a bit circular. You need private property to protect democracy; but private property \&c is politically grounded. So you need democracy to protect private property. This is an infinite regression). He says that the establishment of reliable property rights lengthens time horizons of political leaders and informs against monopoly rent-seeking, and therefore provides the grounds for economic growth. But likewise, those rights must come from somewhere - and he says that somewhere is politics! So what comes first? },

Difference - that unlike in markets, in politics you don't necessarily get Pareto-optimal outcomes from each individual acting in their own self-interest (collective action problems). Furthermore, the presence of institutions of varying kinds alters the individual's perception of their self-interest. The Model: 1. Links microprocesses to macroprocesses and events 2. Assumptions defined ex ante (reduces explanatory power but allows testability) 3. Relies on constraints to create incentives and disincentives 4. Assumes strategic action: that is, an individual's decision is based on optimization within a landscape of other individuals' decisions 5. The system tends towards equilibrium. Hence changes to one part of the system will set off processes to reorder the equilibrium state. The modes of analysis 1. Path Dependency: Given steps down a path, reversal costs are high. Why? Because individual expectations are shaped by those initial steps, which means their rational decision-making is shaped by those steps. Moving off the path requires stepping back from this decision-making context and finding another context in which to see a given set of problems. This is very hard, and potentially very costly. 2. Analytic narratives that assume that outcomes are derived from aggregated individual choices. Problems: 1. Reliance on stylized facts, inherited from econ 2.

Thus, an actor should reasonably suppose that there are solid links between my a priori judgement of the situation and outcomes from applying that judgement. What Rat Choice is not: 1. Actorless (as in structuralism or institutionalism) 2. Irrational, in the sense of denying links between means and ends. What Rat Choice is: 1. Weak Requirements: a. No contradictory preferences b. No intransitivity (e.g. if a>b and b>c, a>c) c. Probability-based calculus 2. Strong requirements: Strategic interaction and equilibrium a. Strategies of interacting players are mutually optimal when in equilibrium b. Probabilities approximate reality in equilibrium (e.g., there is convergence in reality and the perception of reality) c. Beliefs approximate reality in equilibrium Argument that Rat Choice should be taken as correct not simply because it makes accurate predictions (which could leave open the question of whether people really are rational) but because its assumptions about behavior are correct. Why should we believe this: 1. People learn. When assumptions don't match reality, they tend to readjust their assumptions. Over time, this implies convergence. 2. Not everyone has to be rational in the beginning to achieve ostensibly rational outcomes (e.g., if even a subset are rational, they will choose optimizing conditions in such a way that will lead to equilibrium that is optimizing for all. Labor-markets as an example.) 3. Natural selection should reinforce rational behavior 4. Rat Choice is only concerned about rationality of hte population - not of every individual. What matters is the mean level of rationality, not the components of that mean. Why should we deal with the continual re-sorting of assumptions and ex ante preferences required by rat choice? 1. Allows us to understand how features of society - institutions - shape individual behavior through constraints. 2. Four major advantages: parsimony, equilibrium analysis, deductive reasoning, and generalization. Parsimiony: outcomes explained as deliberate choices, with testable propositions about why those choices were made Equilibrium: allows understanding of change; if we assume things tend towards equilibrium, then by starting at a equil. and changing features of the system, we assume that things will change to some future equil. Deduction: Allows us to reason from a set of assumptions; mismatches between deduction and reality provide inputs on how to modify those assumptions. This is a process of knowledge accumulation. Generalization: moves us beyond discussion of immutable differences like culture. },

Rat Choice, by offering a microfoundational explanation for these objects, has assisted the rapid development of political science. Problem is ambiguity: social science is bad at being unambiguous in its definitions. Where this is least problematic is economics - because it can study prices and quantities, which are small, highly defined units. From there, generalization is easier. Lacking these features, generalization is only possible if you can assume common behaviors across your objects of study. In this case, rational choice, by assuming rationality across its subjects, allows for generalization. Defining Features of Rat Choice: 1. Individuals see the world as a set of ordered preferences 2. Choice from among these preferences is made to so to maximize utility Note what this doesn't require: that the preferences be complete; that the actor's information about the preferences be complete; or that the preferences correspond to the ultimate goals of the individual. These two features give rat choice internal coherence. Since common behaviors are assumed for all actors, we can assume that transplanting people into given sets of circumstances will result in similar reactions. },

	Annote = {QUESTION: If Fordism required Keynesianism, how to explain 1900-1950? Real keynesian politics didn't arrive in the US in non-crisis form until the postwar era. Prewar / pre-1929 politics were classical monetarist, as in Hoover. So clearly something else must have been present during this period if the market was as rigid as they claim. Argument: the changing international logic of production means that social protection systems, properly understood, have a critical role to play in reorganizing economic structures in a fluid global economy. Cf. Denmark (flexicurity) vs. Germany (rigidity). Old system: Keynesian Fordism. Fordist manufacturing generated large economies of scale but economic rigidities. Keynesian demand management and unemployment protection mitigated the effects of the rigidities (in particular the recessions and layoffs that ran through the business cycle). The advent of lean production (Japan) and flexible specialization / diversified quality production (Europe) threatened the US Fordist system in the 1980s. Both had different roles for the state than the Keynesian Fordist Model. Wintelism and CPNs imply a new set of changes for the role of the state in policy. The state encouraged it by deregulating the IT and telecom markets (IBM and AT\&T). The result was a disaggregated economy. Once that happened, it became much easier to move functions internationally, setting the stage for a new set of challenges to the state and the labor market. How do states compete when everything becomes mobile? (Thus - modularization of production / corporate activity + algorithmic revolution allowing increasing unbundling drives changing landscape for national economic advantage.) Firm-level response: Shift from services that are valuable because they link to manufactures to manufactures that are valuable because they have links to services (e.g. the IBM 360 vs. the iPod). How do states respond to the unbundling / digital change element of the economy? -NO apparent link between equity and efficiency, as suggested by the nordic economies. -Social protection, if it buffers against mass economic dislocation, can make competition easier. E.g., the Danish system both cushions against dislocation and provides retraining. Where social systems are a problem is when they ``protect against change'' rather than ``protect for change.'' Because they tend to concentrate individuals in sectors of an economy, they delay change rather than promote adaptation. Hiring / firing rules are one example. },

	Annote = {Two developments shape significant changes in the global economy: 1. Wintelism: the changing logic of market control, shifting control away from vertically integrated production networks and to control over market-set standards for components. The result changes where value is created in the market, how products are marketed, and how firms compete. 2. Cross-national production networks: the ability to separate out stages of production allows countries to specialize in these stages, and for firms to build international production networks on the basis of national specialization. This reduces the demand for vertically integrated production. It also means that firms become much more flexible, but also much less tied into their home economies. Manufacturing becomes a commodity service, not a competitive advantage. Advantage derives from the ability to organize and control production chains, and to embed value in commodified products. The result: national comparative advantage still matters in an age of globalized production, but national specialization puts new demands on politics. Pre-Wintelism: vertically integrated production allowed capture of markets via 2 mechanisms: proprietary standards and rent capture (e.g., IBM 360 mainframe technology and all the stuff that went with it); or control over the entire production process to allow price-quality - based competition. Source of change: disaggregation of IBM and AT\&T via antitrust law pushed technology out into the market and forced these firms to rely on production networks. Wide range of firms resulted, competing in all aspects of electronics and software production. In turn, these firms could recombine in various ways to produce new products using the same sets of technology. Network-driven manufacturing meant standards setting was thrown to the market. Market dominance now came not through vertical control of propietary standards, but through control of the IP and licensing of standards. A new mode of competition emerged. What now mattered was compliance with this broader network of products. The final ``box'' mattered only insofar as it plugged into this set of standards. Hence the dominance of the Wintel paradigm and its importance to marketing. The specific features of American antitrust policy meant that US firms were uniquely positioned to accomplish this change in production logic, in the same way that Japanese firms were uniquely positioned to create lean production. CPNs Wintelism = shift of prodution to rapid evolution on the basis of standardized components that evolve rapidly in accordance with market-driven standards. CPNs are an extension of that logic, in which the different demands of various component manufacture create opportunities to place entire nations at specific points in the production chain (NOTE: significant that these are small nations. It's one thing for Taiwan to become the world DRAM leader; this is not an option for the US) Thus mfg becomes a service. Value lies in design; mfg is contracted out. Control over mfg still important, but in the sense of control over the production chain, not control over the actual means of production. Likewise, control of standards still important, but in the sense of organizing the coalitions necessary to protect a given market-set standard, not in controlling a proprietary standard. Finally, seem to be little reason to believe that Wintel forms of innovation and production won't diffuse transnationally and beyond the computer / IT world. NOTE: OK so far as this goes, but it depends on a few things: 1. Free trade 2. Cheap fuel 3. Relative peace 4. Means of contract enforcement to control CPNs Not at all clear that these things are changed by the rise of different means of production. And the forces unleashed by wintelism may make it more difficult to guarantee some of these; (1) in particular.},

@techreport{Baldwin2006,
	Abstract = {Three eminent economists from Princeton University have recently argued that globalisation has entered a new phase that requires a new paradigm understand. This paper examines what is new in the new paradigm and considers the policy implications for Europe. Roughly speaking new-paradigm globalisation differs from the old in that it is occurring at a much finer level of disaggregation. Due to radical reductions in international communication and coordination costs, EU firms can offshore many tasks that were previously considered non-traded. This means that international competition -- which used to be primarily between firms and sectors in different nations -- now occurs between individual workers performing similar tasks in different nations. The really new feature is that deeper new-paradigm globalisation will seem quite unpredictable from the perspective of firms and sectors. Since individual tasks can be offshored, globalisation may help some workers in a given firm while harming others. Moreover, old-globalisation's correlation between skill groups and winners and losers breaks down. Certain highly skilled tasks may turn out to be offshorable, while other highly skilled tasks are not. Increased offshoring will therefore not systematically help or hurt skilled workers in the EU. In particular, many ``Information Society'' jobs are prone to offshoring so EU policies aimed at moving workers into Information Society jobs may be wasted since those jobs are only `good jobs' because they do not yet face direct international competition. The paper argues that this has important implications for the EU's competitiveness strategy, education strategy, welfare states, and industrial policy. The underlying theme is that the increased unpredictability should make EU leaders more cautious about moving workers or skills in a particular direction. Flexibility is, as always, the key to allowing Europe to seize the opportunities of globalisation while minimizing the adjustment costs. },

	Annote = {Globalization as two unbundlings: 1. The end of the need to make goods close to the point of consumption (rise of free trade) 2. The end of the need to practice various stages of manufacturing near each other (rise of disaggregated production chains) (2) also includes the ability to make previously immobile production stages mobile. This has the direct effect of changing the correct level of analysis. The Firm is no longer the correct level, because now the firm is disaggregated. The First Unbundling: Features: 1. Two waves: first in the North, in the 19th century; then in the South, in the 20th. 2. Industrialization, followed by deindustrialization 3. Intl divergence, then convergence 4. Rising levels of intl trade 5. Growth take-off (switch from Malthus to Solow) 6. Urbanization 7. Rising income inequality Sources of these features: 1. Increasing returns to spatial clustering (so long as countries occupied a policy space between perfectly open, costless trade and total autarky, there were advantages to locating things near to each other. Network externalities persisted). 2. Home market effects - home market goods preferred because of trade costs; and home market competition to lower costs will be stronger when trade costs are low (more entrants from outside) because trade helps enlarge markets and preserve profitability. (e.g., one additional firm entering a monopoly autarkic market cuts profitability substantially; one firm entering a large, open market dilutes profitability only a little; therefore many more firms can compete in open markets, and thus lower trade costs encourage better competition). Results: 1. Falling trade costs encouraged economic specialization in the production chain 2. Industry concentrated in larger regions 3. Wealth concentration in the north due to clustering and home market effects 4. Rapid GDP growth. But: rapidly falling transportation costs create incentives to seek low-cost labor abroad, so eventually the North deindustrializes and the south industrializes. Problem: this line of analysis is right for 1800-1990. It assumes that you pick the sectors in which your country will specialize, nurture them, provide sufficient education and training, and thus achieve a stable economic foothold in a globalizing world. But this world doesn't exist anymore. THE SECOND UNBUNDLING: N-S wage gaps, falling trade costs created incentives to begin moving parts of the production chain around. National specialization made it possible to break down the production chain into tasks. Hence national competition now takes place at the task level. Features: 1. Unpredictability. Hard to know what tasks can be moved and what tasks can't. 2. Suddenness. Hard to predict when certain tasks will become vulnerable 3. Individual-level threats, not sectors or skill groups In essence, wage gaps are justified by two things: productivity and coordination costs. If productivity does not change rapidly, and coordination costs fall quickly, a Western wage for some task quickly becomes too high relative to the cost equation, and therefore becomes a candidate for offshoring. With IT services rapidly bringing down coordination costs for many tasks, suggests that globalization is at its infancy. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The current Lisbon strategy of moving to a knowledge-based economy may be flawed, since there's no guarantee that this sector can provide for hte large EU-dev ctry wage gaps. Industrial policy should be geared not towards picking the next winners but in equipping individuals with the tools for flexibility, so that they can adapt to the inevitable and unpredictable changes that will take place in the global economy over the next 50 years. },

Barrington Moore, Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, which spawned a wide research program both validating his claims on his particular test cases of England, Germany, and Russia; and on other countries / regions. The best work done was on his own cases, which challenged his basic thesis and modified it; but much was learned through applying his arguments to other areas, too. 2. Guillermo O'Donnel on core/periphery development and its structural implications for authoritarianism in developing countries as a result of their place in the global production process. In brief, O'Donnel argues that periphery countries are able to enrich themselves enough to create (1) the preconditions for a bourg. (2) to fund a military, and (3) to create labor strife. But it doesn't create enough wealth to buy off labor as was done in developed countries. Labor strife threatens the bourg. and spawns a military coup. Thus authoritarianism is more likely in periphery countries due to the wealth creation aspects. 3. Linz and Stephan on the contingency of leadership in authoritarian revolution. While initially this line of research didn't produce a lot of work, because of its implication that each revolution was very unique and thus offered few cross-national lessons, it did give birth to the ``transitions'' literature that sought to construct unique historical / political analyses of political transition within the framework of regime type and transition type that Linz constructed. This was particularly important in understanding the importance of the prior regime type for the success or failure of hte transition process. In each example, the qualities of the initial research - its clarity of classification, its specificity of causal mechanism, and its presumption of cross-national generalization - created conditions for spawning a much wider research program through which knowledge was shared, developed, and accumulated through time.

Where the aristocracy develops commercial traits that do not depend on the towns, and the agrarian society is preserved, fascism (conservative revolution from above) emerges. 3. Where the aristocracy does not develop commercial traits, and the agrarian society is preserved, communism (revolution from below) emerges. The question is, how does the aristocracy satisfy its growing need for capital and wealth? If done by commerce that requires the towns as a location of trade, and individualized labor as a means of production, it tends to create preconditions for democracy: division of power, a petty bourg. class, a weakening of the king, and common interests between the landed classes and the petty bourg. If the aristocracy develops commerce but achieves higher rates of productivty through coercion - serfdom or slavery - then the aristocracy must ally themselves with the crown in order to preserve that coercive power. Furthermore, the petty bourg. (non-landed commercial classes), needing the power of the state to secure commerce, accept its lack of political freedom in exchange for making money. Agrarian society is left unchanged. The coercive requirements create an inherent tension of oppression and domination within the society that in the end can only be resolved through fascist methods - notably, militarism, glorification of agrarian virtue while encouraging big business, and so on. If the aristocracy extracts wealth via slavery but develops no commercial interest, then the question of rural rebellion from below comes down to how extractive the aristocracy becomes. Moore asserts that the basic question is, do the aristocratic elements of society - the landlord, soldier, and priest - extract a fair amount for the services they provide, or are they exploitative; and are those services clear and useful to the peasant, or not? If the latter, then revolution is more likely. Thus, a lack of commercial revolution may require more significant and coercive extraction from the peasants to satisfy the demands of the aristocracy. If this is done, and peasant society is left unchanged, the new strains put on it by these new demands may create conditions for revolution. },

Ethnicity is usually put in service of political motivation but is not the root of said motivation. Otherwise, how to explain that ethnic differences have often existed for a long time without political motivation, only to suddenly become important due to some external event. Hence politics is using ethnic differences to forward its ends. Furthermore, ethnicity can be created. See the idea of ``Germanness,'' which for all intents and purposes didn't exist prior to the Romantic era and is arguably wrong. The belief is ``subjective.'' The better term for this is ``Nationality'' in the sense of belonging to a Nation: a politically constructed group that claims to share common ethnic / linguistic / cultural features that provide the basis for community and solidarity, and which can therefore be used for political purposes. The Nation The Nation, and national identity, is NOT founded on empirically observed traits. Rather, it is founded on constructed traits - and through being so founded serves the need for ``prestige'' or ``status'' interests in the constituted group.

Politics organizes itself around the set of rules needed to enforce the means of production then in place. Each subsequent means of production empowers one group at the expense of another, thus creating a tension that is resolved when the oppressed group becomes large enough to overthrow the system and impose a new one. In the case of capitalism, the central feature of the means of production is the division of labor. Consistent with Das Kapital, Marx argues that the division of labor is (1) necessary for the capitalist system of production, (2) responsible for the alientation of man and labor that is at the root of the oppression of the proletariat, and (3) required by the bourgeouise in order to provide sufficient returns to capital. Since the government is held by the bourg. through their control of property, the government's coercive mechanisms are applied to perpetuate the system. The natural logic of capital accumulation, however, reduces the number of property-holders and increases the size of the proletariat until a crisis creates a revolution. The Germans, in his analysis, do not have this history because they do not (at that time) have industrialization. Thus they are misguided in believing that German ideas or politics create History qua the historical development of man, since that can only occur within the process of German industrialization. Furthermore, the Revolution he envisions can only occur once capitalism is at its highest state, since only then will the proletariat be sufficiently large to unite under the pressure of the crisis of capitalism and revolt. Marx then argues that the proletariat overthrow will end this historical process because it resolves the alienation of man and work, and reintegrates work into the social system. Hence, because there is no one group oppressing the other (at least after the bourgeouisie has been destroyed), there is no dialectic to drive history. Notes: 1. Marx does not envision the mass embourgeoisment of the proletariat. Hence he does not believe that hte proletariat who are enriched by other forms of revolution - say by aristocratic overthrow of monarchal power or through the slow process of property acquisition in the petty bourg. - and so there is no other way to resolve the bourg-prol conflict than the communist revolution. 2. Capitalism seen as basically individualistic, as epitomized by the division of labor. But Marx sees this as unnatural - full human development is only possible in a community where man can develop all his skills, not just those connected to his place in the production line. 3. Classes exist only so long as they have different interests in relation to the government (and the means of production). With those differences abolished, there will emerge a class-free society. 4. The state is CREATED by property and the need to protect it. In Marx's view, the state did not exist until property became private. Thus the state's interest is aligned with property's interest. 5. But property is ``accumulated labor'' and thus does not rightfully belong to the property owner, since it is in fact property of the laborer with whom it accumulated. },

	Abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis- `a-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition. },
	Annote = {Two major points 1. That not all ethnolinguistic cleavages are politically salient 2. Cultural differences are not necessarily more powerful than noncultural differences for generating political cleavage. In this specific case, the argument is that a particular cultural cleavage was important in one country and not in another dependent on whether the two groups had sufficient size to work as a mobilized political group. If they did, then the cleavage became important to politics. If not, then other factors took precedence. Hence it is not enough to say ``there is a cleavage in culture, which therefore must be a cleavage in politics.'' Rather, there are other conditions set by the characteristics of the group itself (structural characteristics) that matter to whether the cleavage will be important. Those things are outside group control. The specific case used Tumbuka and Chewa tribes on either side of the border between Zambia and Malawi. In Malawi, they were political rivals, while in Zambia political allies. The key difference appears to be the much larger relative size of both tribes in Malawi compared to the tribe sizes in Zambia. },

The form of government regulation created specific conditions that spawned intense domestic competition among large firms and forced a pattern of continuous production innovation amidst declining cost curves. This both created preconditions for international competitiveness and made entry of foreign firms lacking these production innovations very difficult. 3. The pattern of development created a specific pattern of international trade, where rising and declining industries were protected but internationally competitive ones were set to dominate because of their superior production systems. Ultimately, then, the question for the 1990s is, how much of the old superstructure of state-led development remains, and how much must remain for the Japanese system as we know it to remain competitive in an international environment?

	Annote = {Ch2 The crisis is both policy failure and structural failure. Neither explanation alone can explain how Japan got to where it is now. Policy failures: -Anti-inflation bias in spite of evidence that Japan had entered a period of deflationary recession. Why? Both because of the BoJ charter and its perceived responsibility for stimulus after the Plaza accords. The latter explains why rates didn't go up earlier, the former explains why it didn't cut rates later. -Lax banking regulation encouraged banks to make risky loans in low-interest-rate environment during the 1980s; fear of general financial collapse after 1989 meant that the BoJ and MOF were reluctant to let banks with bad loans fail, and so created huge moral hazard for the financial system. These two failures feed each other: low R fed the housing bubble amidst weak regulation; higher R popped the bubble and ruined banks exposed to interest-rate risks; fear of further damage dragged out the bailout. Bank's deflation bias meant that even with negative real interest rates, borrowing still suffered. And MOF bias towards balanced budgets early in 1990s kept govt from acting as a source of stimulus. STRUCTURAL FACTORS -Use of state capacity for intervention shifted from promotion of winners to protection of losers (e.g. from ``competitive'' to ``protected'' sector) -Savings rate was so high that domestic consumption couldn't restart the economy; Japan didn't realize this until very late because of institutional bias towards high saving and its opportunities for investment allocation -Forced opening of markets made for a structural misalignment between Japan's place int he global economy and the capacity of its bureaucracy to manage the economy. -End of the lean production era, move to innovation meant firms poorly placed to compete in innovation What doesn't make sense: 1. ``Japanese economy's structural problems result from the crisis; didn't cause them.'' But it was the bubble that caused the crisis, and the structural features of the economy that created the bubble (cheap credit, govt sponsorship of banks, lean production economy with poor R\&D support, etc). 2. Vogel seems to argue that it was policy failure that created the crisis and structural failure that resulted from the crisis. But his explanation of why the policies failed seems to endorse certain structural features of the Japanese economy - the biases of the BoJ and MOF, the preferred mode of innovation, etc. Ch3. Policy reform NOT 2 Japans, one favoring reform, the other resisting it. These two are closely linked, as in his 1999 piece on political coalitions and parties. Ch7. Japan's New Model General assessment: Japan has liberalized, but in the process it has removed some of the elements that provided social stability. The result is an economy that occupies an unstable equilibrium and will therefore continue to change. Moreover, the changes have been ``patterned'' - that is, shaped by prior existing bureaucratic and institutional structures. -Lifetime employment still exists but within the employer association context, not as mandated at the national level -Banks less dominant but still hold central role in firm investment -MITI still around but now as sponsor of overseas investment rather than investment in Japan But the system isn't fundamentally transformed: the links that defined the Japanese economy in the period of rapid growth remain. Actors have preferred to bend those links to new tasks rather than break them and seek their fortunes separately. Hence Japan, despite its fascination with the US, hasn't converged on a U.S. model. Nor has it converged on a stable equilibrium. Rather, it has turned some old institutions to new uses as it adapts to changed domestic and international settings, but has not in all cases replaced broken or discarded institutions with new ones better suited to these changed conditions. },

	Annote = {Basic argument: that the structure of Japanese production, industry-labor relations, and civil society has connected winners and losers from potential state liberalization in such a way that blocks reform. Because the winners have much to lose if the losers protest, they see their interests as closely aligned with those who would avoid liberalization. Thus the domestic political constituencies for liberalization are few, despite the fact that nearly everyone acknowledges that liberalization is necessary. ``Competitive'' and ``Protective'' sectors. Ties: 1. Consumers. Traditionally linked to farms / unions / trade groups, and see big companies as working against their interest. Thus when these allies resist reform, consumers tend to adopt their views. 2. Industry Since even competitive corporations often benefit from some form of protection, they are unwilling to advocate even minor liberalization where it would benefit them, for fear of starting a process that would eventually hurt them (e.g. anecdote of liberalizing brokerage commissions as a way of cutting costs, resisted for fear of liberalization of insurance commissions that were profitable). Likewise intermediate goods protection, which raises prices for final goods mfgs, is not fought because those final goods mfgs also benefit from protection. Similar story told with labor. Close labor-industry ties and negotiations mean each is familiar with the other's interests. Little desire to strain these relationships over tertiary battles. 3. Political parties End of LDP hegemony post-1993 has not created new parties that split loyalties of protected and competitive sectors. Why? In part, because the protected groups are more reliable supporters (financially) than competitive groups. Urban voters remain fickle in political support. Thus parties are still forced to rely on a core set of voters whose interests resist liberalization, thus retarding the ability to carry out serious reform. 4. The Bureaucracy Bureaucrats, benefitting from the independence of the ministries and the power they hold, use liberalization as a way to enhance their power at the expense of other ministries. The only groups supporting real liberalization are those without any political clout. Those who do support it and are powerful lack credibility - as in MITI as a reformist champion. Hence real bureaucratic liberalization requires a whole set of interministerial bargains to be renegotiated, because each ministry's power depends on where all the others sit. Results for the pattern of reform: Reforms are more likely to succeed via carefully crafted bargains that play out over time, allowing adjustment of interests and providing payouts for losers, than they are through big-bang style deregulation. Reforms are also likely to open up new areas of behavior without closing off old ones (e.g., with corporate governance, which did not prohibit the older concertation-style form even as it allowed firms to choose, if they wished, a shareholder-centric model more similar to that in the US.) The need to orchestrate these bargains keeps the state at the center, even amidst liberalization. Hence consistent with Vogel's earlier argument that the state stays involved, in particular in this case because of the lack of a welfare state to soak up the effects of adjustment. },

How does the Japanese story fit with that of Asia as a whole? ``Policy of administrative guidance'': Strong bureaucracy with control of finance and regulatory instruments used directed capital to encourage certain industries and set the terms of competition. High rates of domestic savings, encouraged through setting interest rates at artificial levels, allowed state-control of investment. Resulting overproduction and excess capacity created conditions for export industry, while conditions of domestic competition drove development of lean production as a solution to the falling costs that were a consequence of overproduction. Role of finance: assurances from the state that finance would be available and cheap essentially ensured Japanese firms against risks of using cost to aggressively pursue market share. Amid falling costs, the only way to both compete and remain productive was to drive costs out of production processes, leading to lean production. State was insurance agency for production innovation. Market logic has changed in sense that standards are now in flux; Japan innovated in production, not standards. Market competitiveness driven by ability to produce to pre-defined standard. This doesn't work so well when standards are undefined. Given bureaucratic dominance of standards-setting processes, it suggests firms are less able to compete in this world. Finally, Zysman et al suggest that this change has meant that emerging markets must first establish themselves as production centers before becoming innovators, due to the capital cost and risk of innovation. Hence they become dependent on MNCs for development because the internal costs of doing it themselves are too high. The Japan model is therefore limited in time and space.},

	Annote = {Argument: that Japan's strength in consumer electronics failed to become a strength in telecommunications because of specific political / institutional factors that diverted Japanese manufacturers from key technological innovations in both telecom and networking. Failure to move with the technological winds meant an inability to apply Japanese rapid-innovation / manufacturing processes to new markets, leaving them behind. Central to the story is the dominant role of NTT as monopsony buyer in the Japanese telecom sector. It's decision to go with ATM networking over TCPIP and its emphasis on a proprietary Japanese cellular standard forced Japanese firms to comply with technologies that were not adopted by the rest of the world. Only after a long, slow, and incomplete process of institutional dismantling and deregulation were these producers released from the monopsony market and put in a position to compete on world-standard technologies. Why was NTT reluctant to go with world standards: 1. Institutional emphasis on telephone-like reliability standards that made TCP IP too unreliable 2. Institutional pride at being technology innovators and standards-setters that meant Japan had difficulty working within world standards bodies 3. Emphasis on formalized standards that didn't fit with the new, informal, market-tested standards approach adopted by the internet community and sponsored by the US 4. Monopoly power over telecom networks that restricted access for internet diffusion And once technological bets had been made, they were politically difficult to reverse even after it was known that they were the wrong bets. Production mechanisms were also affected - see reliance on integrated rather than modular handset design in the cellular market, which made export difficult for Japanese handset mfgs. Implicit: participation in intl informal standards bodies weakened the NTT's institutional power, hence its reluctance to take part. Also implicit: Japan had never before had to choose a set of global standards. In prior markets, they were more or less established. Cars were cars, cassette tapes were cassette tapes, Betamax failed miserably but VHS succeeded. But to do modern telecom you had to choose a set of standards, and the Japanese reverted to form in choosing proprietary standards. },

Thesis: the French mode of postwar economic development dependent on credit rationing; and that the financial system played the critical role in the three great postwar struggles for French economic structure: the institution of the Plan, the Rural / Urban conflict, and the introduction of international economic competition into a formerly closed economy. Problem: how to pull off economic transformation while pacifying those who would lose - mostly rural farmers and small shopkeepers. Finance was critical to this project. (1) Survival of the plan. Monnet rejected direct intervention in economic planning, preferring credit allocation as the tool to encourage specific sectoral development. Labor helped ratify this decision - which ultimately meant very close state-industry ties and little role for labor - with its 1947 rejection of the Marshall plan on orders from Moscow. In turn, the Marshall plan's demand for Planning, even while administered by the Tresor, built the crucial link between the Tresor and the Plan that would be necessary to carry out the credit-rationed development strategy. (Note section on financial structure of the French state: concentric circles of financial control, from the Tresor to the Bank de France to the three large parapublic banks - Agricole, National, and Aisse de Depots, to the other banks, and finally BNP and Suez. Decisions made at the center on credit pricing invariably trickled out to the periphery, since those decisions controlled access to loanable funds. Thus even if banks weren't explicitly carrying out industrial policy, they were forced into making administrative decisions about funds allocation rather than market decisions; those admin decisions were influenced by the political viability of various industries, which was linked to their place in the Plan.) French finance as ``credit based with administered pricing.'' Landscape of modernization: 1. Finance Linked Tresor to Plan 2. Finance helped obscure specific decisions: by controling credit, rather than specific subsidies, it was less clear where Paris was allocating funds; this made the political battles over industrial subsidy less bloody and improved the power of the state to effect policy. 3. Conservative majority post-1958 included ``losers'' - rural farmers and shopkeepers - as well as industrial winners. It excluded labor. Thus the conservatives could run the Plan with some confidence, since their base had nowhere else to go. 4. EEC introduced international economic competition to break the tendency of French firms to cartelize production. 5. The government specifically paid off various groups that otherwise would have opposed modernization (e.g. via the CAP). Amid payoffs, inflation was used as tool to reallocate funds in society, mostly by reducing the value of social benefits that were paid to losing groups. Two mechanisms: straight price inflation, and transfer-cost inflation driven by wage increases in modern sectors that bleed over into declining sectors. NOTE: that the character of the intervention changed over time and produced different sets of problems. Notably, the Gaullist ``National Champions'' phase created companies that the state became beholden to, that resisted adjustment, and that could not be touched without significant political consequences. Hence the problems, in part, of the 1970s. Giscard's attempt at ``liberalization'' in the 1970s was stymied in part by this outcome of the 1960s. Finally, note several post-1968 problems: 1. The modernization / anesthesia combination works if the productivity gap between modern industry and declining industry isn't too great. this was the case with rural ag and steel, for instance. But this doesn't work as well when the gap is very large, as with high-tech and ag, because the winners are losers are much more evident. 2. Dirigisme in service of catch-up is easier than dirigisme in service of innovation. 3. Labor now demands a seat at the table, unlike in the 47-68 period },

The state's ability to do so was dependent on the capacities of its welfare state. In other words, the ability to liberalize state-centered economies depended on having a welfare state. France had one, and reform went forward; Japan did not, and reform suffered. Origin of the problem: statist economies are very good at catch-up, where the problem of which industries should develop is well-defined. It is not very good at figuring out how to build a high-tech economy, where by definition innovation - unpredictable and chaotic - could not be state-driven. Parallel to this, France lost the tool of competitive devaluation when it joined the EMS; and lost its postwar labor quietude with the Socialist - Communist alliance of the late 1970s. Thus the old dirigisme didn't work. But changing to the new one required (1) injecting market forces into the economy again; (2) encouraging the small firm sector at the expense of old industry, and (3) keeping labor quiet through these changes. Doing these three things required, ultimately, buying off labor through social protections. This is the ``social anesthesia state.'' Problems of this state: 1. Perpetuates weakness at the local level, since the state is still all-powerful. 2. Cost is very high 3. Benefits are short-lived. Because the system pays people not to work, it does not prepare them for new jobs in a new economy (unlike, say, the Flexicurity system in Denmark). 4. Duration of passivity short-lived. It's one thing to pay someone off for a year, quite another for life. At some point, even a generous minimal level of subsistence becomes unacceptable for social / moral reasons. Nevertheless, the French experience in liberalization is more successful than the Japanese experience, in part because of the presence of the welfare state to pacify losers. The state has thus not been shrunk; rather, it has been redeployed. },

Rather, it was a conscious choice on the part of hte Socialist party, motivated by the threat of electoral defeat, to reform dirigisme at a time when they enjoyed a long time horizon to see it through to success. Problems of the other explanations: Neoliberal: The French state functioned very well as economic mediator through the 1960s. Thus it's not that dirigisme was fundamentally wrong - in some cases, it produced very strong growth. International institutionalism: The argument that dirigisme only worked under the relatively controlled form of Bretton Woods, and not at all under the constraints of the EMS (where competitive devaluation and inflation weren't possible). But why when faced with the choice between the EMS and dirigisme did the Socialists pick the EMS? Counterargument: French Socialism of the early 1980s intended to effect a break in France's political economy in order to deliver jobs and income to its electoral base: the working class, made more important by the inclusion of the Communists in the coalition. But by 1982-83, this had not happened: state spending was up, inflation was up, the franc was under threat, and job growth was anemic. The Socialists thus stood to lose in upcoming elections if nothing was changed. The key question was thus how to pull off hte change. Doing so in 1983 made sense because of the long electoral period (Mitterand not up for re-election until 1987), which made it probable that positive effects of a neoliberal turn would be felt before the election was contested. Moreover, the very strong position of hte Socialists meant they could weather the departure of the communists without losing control of the Assembly. NOTE: Problems of dirigisme itself were at the root of the Socialists' problem. First, it was basically Fordist, favoring large assembly-line style firms and encouraging the concentration of industry with an eye towards efficiency through scale. Second, its National Champions quickly turned from being instruments of state policy to constraints on state policy because of their pivotal role in the economy: they became too big to fail. Third, the first wave of modernization was pulled off with success; remodernization of plant and firms was resisted. Thus the only way to move from the Fordist economy to a high-tech economy was continued subsidy of Fordism with new subsidy for high-tech, a very expensive proposition. (Also note: dirigisme required an insulated technocracy so to avoid capture by industry groups. But the lack of state-industry communication kept the bureaucrats isolated from changes to industry that made old strategies unteneble.) Thus the problems of French-style dirigisme itself forced its reform. The French state was not universally strong, and where it was strong it impeded development of a non-Fordist economy because of its emphasis on centralized control. These problems were reinforced in the 1970s in pursuit of social peace after 1968. And so by 1980, dirigisme had become an impediment to economic growth, where in the 1960s it was a help. CHAPTER 7: Dillemmas of Institutionaal Reform in Post-Dirigiste France Thesis: that the failure of hte French state to expand local associational politics is also the failure to reform industry; and that both failures have seen the state return to intervention after local politics has failed the coordination problem. Basic French problem: in two major areas, the state has dominated since 1945: industrial relations and financial markets. In the former, the state cut labor out of major industrial policy after 1947, and kept it quiet through a policy of strong growth and social protection. In the latter, the state mediated the financial system, and in doing so prevented the development of internal competency in the banks to do so. This was problematic when, in the 1980s, France tried to turn to a more Danish / German system of industrial and financial relations. Industrial relations required more liberal labor markets for the new economy; the state hoped that, by involving labor in industrial relations, firms and labor together could collaborate on the best way to modernize French industry, without the state directing at each turn. But French labor unions had always been weak, since they'd been cut out of labor relations since 1947. Thus employers were in a position to demand things: lower wages, layoffs, etc; but the unions couldn't press their own demands. The state, fearing social unrest, had to step in - in the form of generous unemployment benefits to soak up the layoffs and wage cuts. In finance, the state hoped for German-style relationship-based banking, in which banks and industry operate in close cooperation to design and finance industrial transformation. But the banks had little experience in doing this, industry was reluctant to accept intervention, and the format of ownership didn't work. Privatisation of industry in the 1980s was clientalist, and produced highly fragmented ownership structures. The owners had little desire to engage in high-cost concertation. Meanwhile, the only bank to truly embrace the ``Banque-Industrie'' ideal, Credit Lyonnais, became the largest bankruptcy in French history, due to its strange parapublic status that encouraged tremendous moral hazard. In short, the lack of prior existing social institutions at the local level - labor unions, business-industry councils, bank-firm relations - meant that attempts to use the local level to perform roles previously filled by the state failed. To preserve economic and social order, the state was thus forced back in. What's happened, then, is that the state is still involved, but in different ways than during dirigisme. It no longer directs labor policy, but funds generous unemployment benefits. It no longer directs finance from the top, but must act as lender of last resort to bail out failing banks and provide finance to firms unable to secure it on private markets. What this means is that the state is weaker than under dirigisme: no major project guides it, and it responds to the demands of the moment. },

	Annote = {Nolte: why in 1980 does the legend of the 3rd Reich live on, and carry such different meanings: one negative, highly dangerous to discuss, and full of guilt; the other inspiring a lunatic fringe in German society? Why is this the case in Germany, but was not hte case for, say, the 2nd Republic of France? Reasons: 1. The scale of war perpetrated by Hitler, and his resistance to all surrendur or capitulation, imprinted an indelible mark on the thoughts of Germans, including a moral guilt seemingly necessary to the continuation of the German people (Lebensnotwendigkeit). 2. The extreme racial / philosophical / cultural philosophy of the Nazis, and its penetration to all German society and its repulsiveness to the rest of Western society (note - but the West had many of these tensions it itself. See Mosley, the Leagues, Petain, Lindbergh) 3. The Holocaust is without comparison in history. There have been and will be other mass-killing incidents, but the nature of the Holocaust goes beyond all of them. The technical precision, cold-heartedness, and industrial methods used are at the origin of htis. 4. The Reich lends itself to cariacature: Hitler, Goring, Himmler, etc are all extraordinary personalities bearing little resemblance to everyday humanity, and thus easily built into images that suggest the uniqueness of hte Nazi regime. But this should cause concern. A permanently positive or negative attitude over any event is a danger to proper history, and the Holocaust is no different. It is myth, not ``science.'' (Wissenschaft). ``staaatstragender Geschichtmythos.'' Thus the question: 35 years after the war, is it time for a revisionist look at the standard narrative of German history in the period of National Socialism? One that avoids the central tendency of the literature to date: namely, for apology to masquerade as history? One that does not treat National Socialism as outside the realm of classical theories of totalitarianism. See, zB, that of Italy, which in revision came to see Mussolini as an alternative to Stalinist dictatorship. Such revision saw communism as the response to the revolution of the individual of the 19th century. Mussolini, by proposing a communitarian but not communist national order, was an alternative to communist revolution. Bad, in that he oppressed political freedom and was on the wrong side of the war; less bad in that he did not destroy the market economy and left Italy in a position to resume membership in the West on better terms. The characteristics of such revision don't work for Hitler, due to the differences between Hitler and Mussolini. But the outlines of possible revisionism are there. Habermas, Eine Art Schadensabwicklung Overall: a critique of Sturmer andHillgruber; the first for his revisionism of the collapse of the Eastern Front and the portrayal of both German soldiers and civilians as, at least in some sense, victims of the rapacity of the Red Army; the second for his suggestion that the Holocaust was mostly the fault of Hitler and was inconsistent with even the antisemitism of the German people. Habermas sums it up as follows: how much of the war or Holocaust was Hitler's idea, and how much of it was the idea of the German people? How much can the Germans, as a people, be blamed for the war and the Holocaust, and how much was it Hitler and his small cadre? ``wie weit es der Krieg Hitlers gewesen war und wie weit der Krieg der Deutschen?'' (66) He rejects both, and in his conclusion sees both as (1) an attempt at constructing excuses for the past, (2) a search for a national ideologie that will help support the NATO struggle against a supposed enemy from the east, and (3) a tactic to lump the Soviets in with the Nazis as using the same ``technical innovation'' of mass murder, and thus guilty of the same thing and threatening in the same way.

	Abstract = {The state of development of the financial sector does not change monotonically over time. In particular, by most measures, countries were more financially developed in 1913 than in 1980 and only recently have they surpassed their 1913 levels. To explain these changes, we propose an interest group theory of financial development where incumbents oppose financial development because it breeds competition. The theory predicts that incumbents' opposition will be weaker when an economy allows both cross-border trade and capital flows. This theory can go some way in accounting for the cross-country differences in, and the time-series variation of, financial development. },

It assumes that the interest groups worked only to restrict open access, without reference to the role of interest groups in shaping financial markets internally; it treats politics as a 'defect' whenever market restriction is seen, ignoring whether market failures were part of those restrictions; it fails to consider why Britain was an innovative financial market BEFORE becoming a free trader, and France was not; and while they note the possible cleavages for interest groups, they still treat it as an incumbent / new entrant problem. How to account, particularly in the 20th century, for the democratization of markets is left untouched. Moreover, the markets were more complex in the 19th than they suggest, insofar as the role of the middle class investor has to be considered in Britain vs. as in France.},

	Annote = {Thesis: that the degree of social protection observed in an open economy is tied to the skill profile of the workers in that economy. Those with specific skills - e.g., skills relevant to one production process or type of product - will demand social protections against job loss as insurance on their investment in the time necessary to gain those skills. Those with general skills - e.g., managerial or operational - will demand and get less protection, since their skills aren't as liable to be made obsolete by competition from trade. This helps to explain why there's no correlation between levels of GDP growth and levels of social protection: social protection is highly correlated with an economy's particular role in the international economy under the idea of international specialization. Iversen contends that the rise of ``nontraded services'' dilutes this argument, however, since services demand looser labor markets. Thus, he believes, as advanced economies shift towards service provision, coalitions favoring high levels of social protection will be diluted. (See Zysman's critique here). Implicit (1): economic interests are formed by the pattern of skill development in the context of economic demands for those skills. Workers' interests coalesce around whether free trade and technological innovation risk making certain skills irrelevant. Since workers believe that the economy benefits from the investment they make in skills, they demand that they be provided a level of social insurance commensurate with the risk they assume by taking that role in society. Implicit (2): Since ``insurance'' and ``redistribution'' are two sides of the same policy, a country's redistributive system will respond to the same economic conditions, in the same way, as its social insurance system. Comments: (1)Firmly in line with the VoC literature on Liberal vs. Coordinated economies, and the idea of institutional comparative advantage (see Caspar's work on German biotech, rise of process vs. product-based firms); suggests an addition to the finance / politics link, by considering the labor markets as heterogeneous between labor that can and cannot adapt easily due to the structure of its skill base. (2)Suggested extension to work on gender or minority inequality within wage systems. Specific-skill markets tend to be male-dominated; overcoming that requires state intervention to achieve high femaale participation rates. Thus women in specific-skills economies will tend to endorse political action for reducing inequality in the labor market.},

Demand Stimulus (Keynesian counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy) 5. Mercantilism (favoratism of one or the other industries under the guise of strategic trade theory - as opposed to general protectionism as in (3)) (1) and (2) are opposed; 1 is compatible with 3-5 in various ways and under various circumstances. Second set: Possible ways of analyzing social groups and interests 1. Production profile (what goods are produced by the country's industry, and how do international economic developments impact the price / production / competitiveness of those goods on world markets) 2. Intermediate associations (what political parties / corporatist institutions exist to interpret economic difficulty and translate it into policy? Where is power held between these institutions?) 3. State Structure (What state-level institutions and rules make certain policies possible or impossible? How do they channel policy problems into policy outcomes by privileging certain groups or interests? etc) 4. Economic ideology (Is there a dominant understanding of the economy present in the society or not? As, for example, in Great Britain in the 19th century) 5. The International System (What position does the state occupy in the intl system (a la Gerschenkron) and how does that drive its interests in both domestic and international senses? How do domestic responses to international problems (e.g., are you a naval power or a land power) influence choices of political institutions suitable to those responses (e.g. liberal vs. authoritarian) From here, tries to show that the responses of 19th century economies to the 1873-1896 Depression make sense in light of each point in these frameworks. Britain's liberalism was confirmed by its production profile (first-mover industrializer with strong trade base, and dependent on foreign ag), its intermediate associations (two-party system generally reconciled to free trade; strong banks and export industries sponsoring both parties; weakness of attempts at Populism), its state structure (Banks again, esp BOE), ideology (Liberals and Tories as free traders), and the intl system (Presence of the navy permitted it safe passage for its goods; colonies demanded free trade). Germany's authoritarian protectionism was likewise consistent with its production profile (very efficient but capital-expensive mfg looking for market guarantees; and inefficient agriculture needing protection), its intermediate associations (weak, allowing capture of the state by powerful interests and manipulation of those interests in pursuit of other ends, like national cohesion), its state structure (the concentration of power in the executive), its economic ideology (Listian protectionism) and the international system (late industrializer, few colonies, in need of an army to defend against great powers on both sides). Gourevitch is very careful not to draw sweeping conclusions; he states that his rubric is not comprehensive. But he does note that the reasons states arrive at one of the five general economic policy frameworks he presents, in light of international economic shocks, are dependent on how groups within those states conceive and lobby their interests. Those interests, and their ability to lobby for them, are tightly linked to the five policy areas he discusses. },

Implication for interest formation: if individuals are ambivalent, then the way in which they interact with the political system to express preferences makes a huge difference. The author gives the example of polling, but there's no reason voting shouldn't be the same. This implies that politicians have huge leeway to manipulate voter preference in areas where voters are ambivalent or lack enough information to objectively judge different policy proposals. },

The big question is, how long and to what extent can domestic policy preferences persist in an environment of internationally mobile capital? Basically: Gourevitch and others were brilliant but we need tools that are economically sophisticated to make sense of how coalitions and policy choices form in the present of international economic forces acting on domestic economies, and v/v. (Relevance to coalitions: like Gourevitch, assumes actors are largely economic (labor, capital) and interests are formed based on the effects of internationalization on those economic actors (capital mobility, labor immobility, etc)). Introduction: 2 Hypotheses: 1. Internationalization will subject countries to economic shocks leading to political crises 2. Internationalization dilutes domestic policy autonomy 2 Propositions: 1. Opening of domestic markets will make a country more susceptible to international economic shocks, increasing pressure for institutional reforms to meet those shocks 2. Internationalization will undermine national policy effectiveness 2 Corollaries: 1. Internationalization will affect closed economies, too, through rising realized opportunity costs of not opening. 2. Internationalization will empower mobile capital relative to immobile labor and political officials. Conclusion: Three possible paths by which internationalization affects domestic politics: 1. Changing coalitions (cf Frieden / Rogowski) 2. Triggering domestic economic and political crises 3. Undermining the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy (e.g. diluting the ``embedded liberalism'' compromise) Three possible mechanisms by which domestic institutions block international signals: 1. Blocking price signals (tariffs, subsidies, etc) 2. Freezing coalitions and parties (if the parties are durable enough to survive the pressures for shifting coalitions, then they may not change platform - see Britain, late 19th c) 3. Channeling responses to change (shape pressures for policy response to globalization along pre-existing lines of policy preference) Note they argue that (2) is powerful in the short run - but ``short'' in Britain meant 50-60 years, from the emergence of major industrial competitors in the 1860+ period to Imperial Preference in 1931.},

General argument is that an exogenous easing of trade (by, for instance, falling transaction costs) will generate internal pressures for a country to open its own trade policies, because the opportunity cost of not doing so rises. But the form taken by the coalitions for and against trade will vary, according to an analytical framework proposed as follows: Three rubrics: 1. H-O theory supported by the Stolper-Samuelson model, which says that abundant factors of production win and scarce factors lose when a nation opens itself to trade. This is due to the relative price increase of one good, and decrease of the other. Thus the abundant factor will be in favor of openness, and the scare one opposed. 2. Ricardo-Viner: trade- or openness-driven cleavage occurs at the sectoral level, between sectors who are able to use sector-specific factors to compete on international markets, and those that are not. Owners of sector-specific factors thus sponsor or oppose openness depending on whether they can do well by trade. 3. Economies of scale. Trade expands the scope of markets, and therefore generates significant benefits for industries that enjoy increasing returns to scale. Political cleavages develop between industries that do and do not enjoy such returns. Within these contexts, the breadth of support will depend on three elements: 1. How strong and broad pre-existing coalitions are 2. How credible the government is when making promises 3. How long a timeframe the decision-makers act on. Strong coalitions underpinning credible governments with long time horizons will sponsor openness with lots of support, because their time horizon stretches past the short-term benefits of protectionism and their credibility convinces losers that promises about compensation are reliable. },

In fact, it is founded on violence (killing is a natural part of life). Containing that violence is the job of government, and to do so, only violence can be used. Methods: Empiricism, based on a reading of the tragic history of man and the necessity of containing man's violent nature through violence. Power: originates with God, exercised by man through institutions founded on divine order. Manifested in the use of force to generate terror and fear and thus to contain man's more violent tendencies. Political order: Underpinned by God and slavery (God as the origin of enduring institutions, slavery - unquestioning obedience to order - as the response of man to terror and fear). See the allegory of the executioner. Moreover, Enlightenment ideals of inquiry, free speech, and so on, must be banned - because they erode the stability provided by fear and terror, cause men to question the prevailing order and God, and so put the entire system at risk. Hence the Jacobin were inevitable, you could see it coming: as soon as reason was unleashed from fear and terror and separated from religion, restoration of order in society could only come through restoration of fear and terror - through the guillotine. Maistre as the ultimate reactionary: moderate liberal reformer until the Revolution, radical anti-liberal, Catholic, irrational, royalist, authoritarian afterwards. Conversion credited to having witnessed the excesses of the revolution and blamed them on the abandonment of tradition as a check on the excesses of the new. de Maistre. Ch 1-2. Nations are born to certain roles. France was to head the religious order of Europe. In rejecting its religious vocation, France rejected its role - and thus condemned itself to repercussions. The law is not rational. The murder of the sovereign is among the greatest of crimes. That it occurred with so many willing accomplices in France has condemned France to repaying Louis XVI's blood thousandfold. Hence the Terror, which Maistre reads as God's revenge for the crimes of the French against the king and against God's order. The violation of that order required Jacobinism to restore it - to water France with the blood of vengence and restoration. The counter-revolution as desired by the royalists would have been disastrous - because only the Terror could have prepared the way for the Restoration. Violence and terror could only be corrected by violence and terror. Committee of Public Safety is therefore ``miraculous'' in its works. Ch. 3 War is the natural state of mankind. Moreover, all that is good is born of war and violence - the arts, the sciences, the great human monuments. ``Blood is the manure of the plant we call genius.'' Restraining mass human slaughter requires the hand of God, expressed through the hand of the King, in exercise of the instruments of terror and violence. Ch. 4 The French Republic is doomed. Large republics are never successful; small republics have representative institutions bequeathed to them by kings. ``Liberty'' cannot be born of evil, of a movement that is a ``gangrene.'' The revolution is rotten, and rottenness cannot survive. Ch. 5 Philosophy is incapable of supporting enduring institutions. It is essentially disruptive. Only religion can do this. It DOES NOT MATTER whether religion is true or not. Religion binds men together. Philosophy destroys those bonds but has nothing to replace them with. Thus we should not be surprised when the civil order collapses in the wake of a revolution founded on philosophy. Ch. 6 Different orders have different rights. The masses receive theirs from the judgement of the sovereign. The sovereign and the aristocracy receive theirs from the natural order ordained by God. There is no universality in Man: only nations, each with different roles ordained by God. Nations survive by basing their governments on ancient institutions. Those nations possessing liberty from early days show it; those grounded in monarchy show it, and so forth. Nations do not take well to new forms of government with which they have no experience. Clarity is the enemy of law. Law comes, first and foremost, from the king. They do not come from committee - Constitution-writing is a fallacy; laws have ancient roots and survive or do not and perish. There is no middle ground. Ch. 7 The powers of the legislature are overrated. Deliberation does not produce obedience to laws. Real power lies in deciding by fiat and being obeyed, not in debate and careful formulation. Rather, power is held by the king, with the endorsement of God, and used via the promulgation and enforcement of the law with the long arm of the sword. Ch.8 The old French constitution - which haad endured, and was founded on divinity - had everything the Revolution wished for. Thus to reject it in favor of the untried was foolhardy and ultimately tragic. <NOTE: here, Maistre's empiricism breaks down. There was a profound difference between the Constitution de jure and de facto. His allusion to Machiavelli's belief that France was the most well-regulated system of government in Europe suffers from being 200 years old. The Estates-General, whicih Maistre praises as a representative institution that balanced each Estate against the others and the King, hadn't been called in years prior to the Revolution. Taxation fell predominately on the peasants while the rich and the powerful supped at Versailles. This is no empiricism - it is willful deception.> France's only hope is for the restoration of the old constitution under a new king. Hence, all dissent against the king, all partial support, is wrong. Only unconditional support for the king provides a chance for his restoration and a return to civil order. The separation of Church and State is a myth - where it has occurred, it has been disasterous. Ch. 9 The counter-revolution will not come from the people. The people are sheep and will follow power. It will come through the actions of a few, supported by the divine will of God, on the basis of a France so weary of bloodshed and civic turmoil and the debasement of the state and religion that, when the King has seized power again, it will take little for the people to come over to his side. Ch. 10. Those who worry that the counter-revolution will cause yet more bloodshed should not be listened to. For the counter-revolution is a cure for all the evils of the revolution, and so will be the opposite of all the revolution was. Where there was vengence, the king will show mercy; where generalized terror, the king will bring order; where there was equality but no distinction, the monarchy will restore distinction and dignity in all walks of life; where no one now enjoys property for fear it will be taken, the king will restore property; where the old nobles were sometimes cruel due to years of corruption, age and time and the Terror has purged their ranks so that the new nobility will not suffer the same vices; where the emigres would seek revenge, the king in his wisdom will restrain them; <Doctrine of sovereignty important here: believes dignity originates in the bestowment of sovereignty. But since the sovereignty in a democracy is held by the many, it can never be fully bestowed on the one; in a monarchy, the full sovereignty of the king is in force when it is bestowed on any one person. In other words, equality is a sham. To get it, you sacrifice dignity and order, but get little in return. Far better to have sovereignty housed in one man, to have offices graded by civic status, so higher offices are harder to get and thus bear more dignity.> Ch 11. Question: Maistre draws parallels between Britain and France. But didn't he just say that Britain and France were fundamentally different cases? That nations had different roles to play? So why should we buy his argument that Hume's description of the overthrow of Charles I, the reign of Cromwell, and the restoration of Charles II would provide a model for the restoration of Louis XVIII? Moreover, isn't this a hole in Maistre's empiricism generally? If nations are what they were - in other words, if history and tradition and religion are paramount - then you can't draw cross-national comparisons. },

@book{Nietzche1992,
	Annote = {pp218-222 -The search for cause and effect in the life of men obscures the fact that men act mythologically - in the sense of acting according to whether we aare strong or weak. -The free will in the sense commonly understood - as independence within a framework of restraints - is misguided. Real freedom of the will is transcedence of the framework of constraints that limit the weak, such that one is truly independent, accountable for both all suffering and all triumph that man achieves. -The reading of equality in nature so critical to the democratic concept of the soul is misguided: just as easy to read heirarchy from nature - a natural heirarchy of weak and strong, both within and between the races. ``Tyranically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of claims of power.'' -The general condition of life requires the very things a ``democratic conception of the soul'' would reject: hatred, envy, desire, lust - to order it. A true psychology thus rejects any preconception of morality to understand the underlying mechanisms of the mind and their implications for the natural order of life. pp230-266 (28) - language places limits on thought for all but a few. The limits of expression in language - for instance, the problem of sponteneity in German - makes certain things inaccessible in translation - a la Machiavelli or Aristophanes. Cultures, therefore, are inaccesible by extension (NOTE - in disagreement with Vico on the ability of understanding culture, and with Berlin, except in the case of the ``strong.'') (29) - real independence can only be achieved by the few, those of daring and strength needed to endure the isolation and loneliness of the path to independence through self-inquiry. (30)Certain ideas seem stupid or criminal when heard by those for whom they are not intended. Such is the problem of the strong, who understand the natural order of weak and strong, embrace it, endure the suffering necessary to life with it, and so form - all of which seems cruel to the weak. Attempts to make ideas transcendent to all makes those ideas small - ``books for all the world are always foul-smelling'' (32) The switch from judgement of acts on outcomes to judgement on intentions waas profound - reversed perspectives on life. It is time for another such transformation. Morality thus understood was a prejudice. It should be overcome. The process of overcoming morality is a process intended for the best / strongest / most honest of the day. (33) Morality of self-denial must be taken to court. Is the idea ``not for me but for others'' not in itself a seduction, a temptation away from the true self? (34) (35) When a human being is too human about the search for truth, he finds nothing. < Meaning, human in the weak sense, as opposed to in the sense of self-disciplining, lonely road to truth? > (36) Do we believe in the causality of the will? (Triumph of the will - cf. Rifenstahl?) Herein Nietzche's statement of the will to power as the primary driving force of human progress, and thus the driving force of the world. ``All mechanical forces are...effects of the will.'' (39) Truth is not necessarily good - truth may be harmful or dangerous. Thus ``strength'' can be measured as in how much truth one can endure. The search for truth requires looking at evil and enduring it, understanding it. Quotes Stendahl - ``to be a good philosopher, one must be dry, clear, without illusion.'' Thus to be a good philosopher, one must be strong. Hence philosophy is a task restricted to the strong of will. (40) Profundity is masked. Understanding requires removal of the masks - shame among them, which maay disguise the true nature of an act. Not all people can see past the masks. (41) Self-testing is a necessity. The testing is known only to oneself. Independence is all - independence from others, from morality, custom, fatherland, method, even one's own sense of detachment - that it the best. ``Self-conservation'' , an economy in learning and forgetting, forever subjecting oneself to the test to make sure one hasn't slipped again. (42) Versucher / Versuch / Versuchung. (43) The common good does not exist. Agreeing with the many is a temptation, an illusion. Common and good are opposites. The good - greatness, uniqueness, profundity, nuance, refinement - are for the great, the unique, the profound, the nuanced, the refined - and for them only. (44). Hence what we look for is what lies beyond the prejudice of good and evil. The new philosopher attempts (versuch) to find this; his opposite is the democratic man, the democratic philosopher, who concerns himself with the relief of suffering and inequality - as if those things could be relieved without debasing man! The one who does this is at home everywhere and no where, can escape from the confines of man, is independent of temptation, working without need for gratitude or approval, unconcerned with the common, etc. <See the last paragraph - critical statement of hte doctrine of the superman, capable of self-denial, independent of all things.> (45) The search for truth in the human soul permits no outside assistance. (46) Christianity was the continual suicide of reason, the sacrifice of pride and freedom and self-confidence in exchange for self-enslavement, mockery, and mutilation. (47) The concept of the saint - who has achieved the denial of the will - is fascinating for its seeming miraculousness. But perhaps the assumptions are wrong - perhaps the saint, in self-denial of the will, wasn't miraculous, was in fact amoral. (48) Religion is more natural to the southern European than the northern. Religion, as a whole, though, is not natural, does not stem from man's natural pursuit of truth. It is, then, a mask for truth. (49) Fear was a precursor to Christianity. (50) Christianity has something female about it (51) The powerful bowed before the saint because they saw in him the ``will to power'' - not piety. In doing so, they honored it in themselves. (52) The Old and New Testaments are of different orders. The former was a grand book of justice and allegory of triumph and tragedy. The latter is not in the same category - forgiveness, mercy, unconditional love. Joining the two was a ``sin against the spirit.'' (53) Three stages of sacrifice in religion: first the most loved, then one's strongest instincts, then God himself - whaat is comforting, holy, etc, all in the name of self-sacrifice. This is the logic of the religious form of self-denial. (59-60) Religious interpretation of life is based on fear of truth. The idea that love of man is only noble if it comes from love of God is misguided - the idea that love of man is brutish unless God exists to improve it. (61) The strong, the philosopher, makes use of the religious tendency in his project for the development of man. Religion teaches obedience and helps overcome resistance - a tool for the ``strong and independent who are prepared and predestined to command.'' Religion helps the weak masses be content with their life, happy with toil, tolerable of each other. It is thus useful to make the mass of men quiescent as the minority of the strong reshape society. (62) Christianity has degraded the European, by taking the natural order of strong and weak and standing it on its head. It has kept man from improvement and preseved ``what ought to perish.'' The European of today is a ``herd animal'', commanded by those incapable of seeing the natural order of ruled and ruling. },

An directly elected constituitive body 4. A citizenry (thus voting rights) based on land ownership (1) is needed to mediate among the other powers - the monarch's power cannot, per Constant, be vested in the other branches, because then the balancing of powers is inevitably a zero-sum game: certain functions gain only by the loss of others, and the delicate balance of powers is distorted. Far better a specific office that, while not engaged in the day-to-day of governance, can afford to take the longer view towards the protection of the general state of government. (1b) a set of appointed ministers with enumerated powers separate from the monarch, who are responsible for the administration of the laws but who can be recalled should they grow complacent or corrupt. (2) is necessary to support the monarch and to be the intermediate state between the monarch and the directly elected branches. Hereditary priviledges bring, in Constant's view, seriousness that mere lifetime appointment or longer elective terms do not. (3) is required to adequately capture the mood of the citizenry, to invest them with political power, to provide for domestic tranquility guaranteed by the regular exercise of political power, and to inject the concerns of the day as against the hereditary body's concerns of the era. (4) is demanded by what Constant believes is the special role of land ownership in cultivating the mind suitable to make wise choices in the polls. He rejects the idea that agricultural land and industrial property are equivalent, for industrial property haas none of the save virtues of permanence that he finds in agricultural cultivation. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Argument about the different liberties of the ancients and the moderns: The Ancients (mostly, Athens) gave up civil liberties to secure political liberties. They could do so because, in the context of a small polis where the franchise was held only be slaveowners with comparatively large amounts of free time, direct democracy could work only if each member of the polity had a clear picture of what all the others did. Hence civil liberties - basically, the right to a life separate from the community and private - were subordinated to the information requirement of political rights. This does not work for modern society. It is more diverse, larger, more complex, and faster-changing than ancient society. The goal of man in such a society is to carve out a private space through which to achieve his security, not to embrace the whole of society. He has neither the time, nor the resources, nor the close identification with his fellow man, to do so. Rather, the protection of civil rights is all, while his political right to direct democracy is diluted through representative democracy. Mistaking ancient democracy for modern was the root of the Terror.},

@article{Zysman1994,
	Abstract = {Zysman calls this the ``market logic'' - thus in France, concerned about central control, entrepreneurship outside the bounds of state-mediated capital markets was very difficult, and so the 1980s see little development of small firm innovation; or in Japan, protectionism made economies of scale and rapid technological adoption from abroad critical, and so made the firms very fast to innovate and very likely to deploy massive capacity, preparing them for export markets. Questions: 1. Does Zysman still believe (2) in an era of very global supply chains? If it's now possible to source from and sell to almost anywhere, are national trajectories of supply / demand networks as important? 2. If the firm is the unit of innovation, how does national technology policy fit? What about extended R\&D networks? Is it, for instance, the poor university R\&D structure in Germany that leads to a paucity of small firms, or a lack of small firms that results in little commercializable technological innovaiton from German universities?},
	Annote = {Generally, an argument that both patterns of economic growth and technological development are rooted in historic political / economic institutionalism. But Zysman's a little vague on what comes first. Do political goals create institutions that constrain the possibilities for technological improvement (a la Dobbins on the railroads)? Or, with firms already active in the economy, do they create conditions on the ground to which politics responds? Zysman asserts three things: 1. The firm is the unit of technological innovation.

	Annote = {pp48-54, on Tocqueville's analysis of the effects of the French Revolution in ``L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution'' Tocqueville was first to point out that the revolution had destroyed an existing social order that, if unjust, nevertheless made inequality acceptable. In its place, it had set up a two-tiered system of rights. Politically, everyone was to be the same under the law. But economically, the old regime retained much of its wealth, and the former servants by custom were now servants by employment. And so they saw their political and economic inequality as incommensurate. Under such a system, Tocqueville worried about whether it was possible to preserve freedom. Free individuals, the bonds between them destroyed by the revolution, would have few options for amelioration of their situation except to turn to the government. A government empowered by the dependency of the citizen on the state could as easily abuse freedom as it could protect it. America avoids this problem through the strength of its social institutions. This provides a society in which man is equal to all and can observe it. In his working life, there is no shame or feeling of inferiority in entering into contract to perform labor for another. (Note uniqueness to France: concern was ordering. First the feudal system, with reciprocal rights and responsibilities, exists; then the ancien regime destroys this via centralization of power in the king - which leads to the destruction of reciprocity as the middle classes compete for favoritism while exploiting the peasants. Thus when the revolution comes, the classes all look on each other with hatred and suspicion, and are unable to reconstitute a social order in which they can be equal. Since this is then combined with economic inequality, people look to the state to solve economic inequality as a means of correcting the social inequality. And the state's power again grows at the center.)},

An argument that political development can be explained in large part by the pattern of establishment and survival of institutions over time. In this pattern, two things are important: 1. Sequencing (the order in which events take place is critical to the outcome of those events) 2. Path-dependency (institutions tend to reinforce themselves by shaping decisions and outcomes in a way that, over time, generates increasing returns and makes costs of changing more expensive.) Note that Pierson doesn't deny the importance of, say, rat choice methods in evaluating certain outcomes. He does, however, note that their inability to account for historic circumstance or ordering, due their tendency to take mere snapshots of a particular political process, leaves them wanting for better explanation. His attitude toward functionalism is the same: some institutions cannot be explained purely by the functions they perform, particularly if those functions could be performed more efficiently by a different institution. The history matters - both the circumstances of the institution's founding and the institution's precursors. },

	Annote = {1. Historic Institutionalism -Institutions as the principal factor structuring behavior and shaping outcomes -Institutions are broadly defined -Institutions embody power asymmetries -Institutions generate path dependence and unintended consequences from initial actions In brief, institutions alter expectations about the future, and thus alter decisions made now that take those expectations as input. Approaches to understanding this include both a calculus approach - providing more or less certainty about the future from which actors calculate their best action now - and a cultural approach - that institutions shape the culture in which decisions are made and in so doing invisibly constrain the list of choices considered at any point in time. 2. Rat Choice Institutionalism Origins: studies of the American Congress; responding to theoretically unexpected stability of Congressional outcomes. Answer was to realize that the institution of Congress shaped outcomes by lowering transaction costs associated with certain paths of action. Four features: -Rat Choice behavioral assumptions (utility-maximizing, aim for largest majorities possible) -See politics as a set of collective action dilemmas -Emphasize strategic interaction (calculus approach where inputs are expected behaviors of others in process of pursuing given outcome) -Institutions exist because they provide some value in the functions they carry out for the primary political actors 3. Social Institutionalism (See Dobbins) That institutions originate from culture and cannot be understood as spontaneously generated objects. Three unique features: -Institutions are defined more broadly than in the other two types: ``frames of meaning'' guiding human action -Unique understanding of the mechanism through which institutions act: more ``cultural'' than ``calculus'' in the sense of defining a set of perceptions of the world and thus shaping the possible choices made in response to perceived problems or opportunities. ``rational action'' is socially constituted. Strengths and Weaknesses: -Rat Choice: weak at explaining why institutions arise in the first place, usually because it backs into causes from effects (e.g., enough people needed institution X, and so it came into being), whereas often this isn't really sufficient. But generally good at addressing why people behave in certain ways within already-existing institutional settings. -Sociological: better at explaining the genesis of institutions, often by noticing similarities between new institutions and old ones - consistent with the idea that existing institutions shape perceptions. But weak at addressing situations of institutional conflict (e.g., where people within the same institution have different ideas) -Historical: Good at showing how path-dependency works to reinforce institutions over time. Bad at generalizations, because of their reliance on the historical record of the particular area of study. },

	Annote = {Introduction and Conclusion Summary: that structures for managing the economy evolved alongside structures for managing the state, and replicated many of the stat's characteristics; and that those structures not only gave certain people the power to perpetuate the form of railroad regulation, but also shaped their perceptions when doing so, such that future moves to regulate new industries tended to draw on experience in regulating the old, such that the pattern of state regulation in old industries was replicated in new ones. Basic question: why, if, as economists argue, economic laws are universal, do we see such diversity in national economic systems? What if economic laws are not universal in their demands on economic organization? What if, instead, they offer a diverse range of possible outcomes. Then what is the cause of this diversity? Dobbins argues that it is a ``national policy logic'' centered on national culture born of a particular story of national political issues at the point of industrial birth. Thus Britain - born of a political system that emphasized individual autonomy - developed a regulatory system that gave power to small firms and resisted direct involvement in railroad planning and financing. Later government activism was directed at protection of small firms, even via allowing cartelization. France, which struggled constantly with asserting state control over a large and unruly territory, put substantial power in the hands of state bureaucrats to plan and regulate the railways as a means of tying the nation together. The US, with a federal system, left regulation to the states until such time as concentration of power in the hands of a few threatened to weaken federalism, at which point it intervened. Or, as the author says, ``the political structures used to achieve national unity and military glory were soon retrofitted to the need to promote economic development.'' Changed ``Perception'' and ``Selection'': Perception of the problem (e.g. is it a problem of too much industrial concentration, too little, the wrong kind, etc) and selection of the solution. cf. Gerschenkron: Dobbins argues that the ``sequencing'' argument doesn't hold in absolute terms: the US under this analysis should be expected to be the most interventionist of the three states, but it was not. (Though this may be a flawed reading of Gerschenkron - argument is about when and where you industrialize, in relative terms, not absolute. },

@book{Berger1972,
	Address = {Cambridge},
	Annote = {Question: how to explain different levels of state-municipality relations (in the sense of activity in national politics) in different departments in France? Answer: the strength of corporatist institutions tied to agriculture were the determining factor. In areas where they were strong (Finistere, in her study), Party affiliation and party performance at the national level meant relatively little, since the corporatist institution managed most of the state-society relations. In areas where corporatist groups commanded little power, party affiliation and performance meant a great deal, since local outcomes were influenced much more by national actions. Hence the political outcomes seen at the local level: in Finistere, you see consistent party affiliation and relatively low rates of turnover in elected officials, since little was expected of them. In Cote du Nord, the opposite is true, and regular turnover is seen as officials fail to deliver on promises aand are removed in favor of others. Furthermore, since turnover is more rapid in non-corporatist settings, more recent issues tend to be more decisive in elections. Nor can other effects account for this. Income, sectoral distribution, demographics, religion, demographic change (rural exodus), and local political history don't differ much. Where they do - as in local political history - they would be expected to divide each locality internally, rather than present huge differences between the two. Why does organizational membership shape behavior: because it constrains options. If you belong to a corporatist group, it is difficult to appeal to the national government for redress of grievance, as the corporatists have local control over the resources needed for redress. Additionally, the corporatist group may have ultimate choice in candidates for election, thus restricting electoral options for political participation. Note that parties fulfill the same role (selecting candidates and controlling access) but don't do so at the same level.},

	Annote = {Distinguishes between two types of individualism: negative and social. Negative is that of Berlin's ``negative liberty'' in the sense of the individual being able to decide freely for himself how to live, within certain limited societal constraints. Durkheim's is social in that it anticipates that the common humanity of man is the only thing binding together large societies, and that this common humanity is tied to the exercise of reason. That reason is based on knowledge - either of the subject at hand, or of one's ignorance of that subject that should lead one to trust others who are demonstrably more knowledgable. In any case, the attack on the individual is seen as an attack on the exercise of reason, and therefore on common humanity, and thus on the cohesion of society. In this sense, defense of individualism is not an alternative to the defense of society - it is the defense of society. Note that Durkheim isn't compatible with Berlin: he assumes that the individual does not really exist in isolation, since what is important is the common humanity expressed through the exercise of informed reason; nor is political freedom an end, as in Berlin - it is a means to a better, more reasonably society. If not used in such a way, it is, he says, dangerous. (Rationalist view - there is reason, we use it to perceive the world based on knowledge, that knowledge suggests demonstrably correct and incorrect outcomes, thus the need to defer lest one be mistaken, thus one basic ``correct'' world based on the ``correct'' judgements of all those with knowledge?},

@book{Berlin1992,

	Annote = {General argument: that, at root, two kinds of liberty are asserted: negative liberty (the restriction of the scope of powers of coercion exercised by the society and state, with the goal of maximizing the realm of life free of state interference) and positive liberty (the goal of relieving individuals of the burdens or inequities that characterize their lives, under the assumption that it is possible to use the state to improve individuals' lives rather than merely offer equal protection under a limited set of laws.) Berlin is a natural ally of negative liberty, and views the positive kind with caution - potentially useful but also quite dangerous. The ultimate end can be, paradoxically, the curtailment of freedom to achieve freedom. Mill as originator of this idea: civilization advances through the search for truth; truth can only emerge through free inquiry, which cannot by definition occur in a society based on compulsion. Nevertheless, this statement has a problem: can truth not be sought by individuals living under oppressive regimes (cf. Eastern Europe, postwar period). Truth has been sought for a very long time, though real political liberty is a comparatively recent occurance. Despite this, Mill has a critical point: liberty in the sense of freedom from coercion doesn't care so much about who controls as how much control is alloted to the controller. Parliaments may be as coercive as autocrats. Compare with positive freedom, which Berlin defines as ``freedom to lead one prescribed form of life.'' Berlin claims it derives originally from a reasonable idea: that one wants to live by ones own choices, not external forces of any kind. Berlin argues that this isn't too different from negative freedom, but through a series of logical leaps, becomes so. How? Through the separation of the self into two: ``higher'' and ``lower'' or ``selfish'' and ``communal'' or the like. It is assumed that leading the lesser of the two is inevitably a sign of having developed under those ``external forces.'' Thus the state, in educating the individual and attacking those external forces, will aid the individual to achieve his ``true self'' or ``better self'' and thus achieve the ``positive'' freedom he so desires. (Note the problem here is the leap from the individual making this choice to the society - and thus, implicitly, the idea that there is a universal form of the ``higher'' self that must be imposed; no a priori reason to believe this). What does this imply? First, that someone, presumably not the individual, can see the two selves, and second, that they should have the power to do what is necessary to help the individual see it in themself. In one form, this takes the form of asceticism - self-denial in an attempt to reach a higher state. Fine if this is motivated by the individual. But in the limit, if that self-denial is the mental discipline to ``free'' one's self amidst the most oppressive dictatorship by convincing the self that it really doesn't need self-determination, then it in the limit is nonproductive of freedom. See Kant: values originate from free human choice; choice implies the liberty to choose; thus restriction on choice - coercion - in the name of some ``higher'' value is a fallacy, because choice is the highest value of all, from which all other legitimate values proceed. Rationalism is another version of this: it assumes not a higher and lower self, but a rational and irrational self. Various forms of coercion - including education, potentially - are used to ensure that the individual realizes and chooses the rational course of conduct (see not only the Benthamites, but also the Idealists). ``Positive doctrine of liberation by reason.'' Moreover, since rationalism presupposes the internal consistency of everything, this implies only one set of truths - and therefore, one kind of life. Finally, since rational beings want to live in a rational world, they can only achieve this by making the world - and everyone in it - rational; in other words, they must become dictators lest they be condemned to a life where the rationality they can see isn't achieved by their fellows. And so follows dictatorship. Status is another form of positive liberty. If I believe that, since I am not recognized as anything other than an individual, that my true human nature is being suppressed, then I need to rectify this situation by forcing the society to grant me higher status by recognizing my unique characteristics. Implies that my fundamental identity is social, not individual: that I do not exist separate from the group. But the guarantee of status has little relation to guarantees of negative liberty: thus I may be acknowledged for what group I belong to while nonetheless living under the most oppressive of regimes. (Here Berlin invokes the preference of some colonial peoples to be governed despotically by their own rather than less despotically by their colonizer.) Finally, Berlin notes that most revolutions - even the most collective and oppressive - are usually couched in terms of liberation from oppression - and thus ``negative'' liberty. That they can do so suggests a fundamental misconception of where liberty stems from, and where its logic leads. From Mill / Constant / Tocqueville, the preconditions for a free society: 1. No absolute power, only absolute rights 2. Authentic frontiers within which individuals are inviolable, based on long-held rules that make up the conception of what constitutes a normal human being - or, as Berlin says, rules that a person could not violate without revulsion. Where does the impetus to act contrary to these principles arise: the notion that there is one, final, pure, uncorruptable ``solution'' that will yield a utopian life. But, as Berlin notes in his favorite phrase, ``out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.'' Note also - ties to his definition of ``tolerance'' as being able to, within the limits prescribed by negative freedoms, envision that it is possible to live another kind of life than the one you live, to deem that acceptable, and yet still to defend your own life as valid. Tolerance is understanding within a framework of negative freedoms.},

@book{Spencer1994,

	Annote = {1. The New Toryism That the salient difference between the original Liberals and the Tories was the attitude towards the state's power of coercion. The Liberals attempted to restrict that power thoughout areas of private life, while the Tories either attempted to preserve it or expand it. Now, however, the Liberals, in the guise of ameliorating various social ills through supposed ``responsible'' governance, have begun expanding the power of the state and its scope in private life. The result is a narrowing of the political gap separating the two parties: in principle they are the same, though in aims they remain different. 2. The Coming Slavery That the expansion of the state's power of coercion will, inevitably, result in slavery, defined as the ownership of one's decisions in life by another. Spencer argues this is true because early, marginal expansions of state power into civil life do several things: first, they have unintended consequences, often negative, which then require further state intervention to solve but almost never produce a liquidiation of the first act; second, because they validate the idea that only the state has the power to act in amelioration of certain ills, and so inculturate in the citizen the behavior of turning to the state; and third, because the logical end of these expansions isn't the particular goal in mind for the initial act, but the relief of supposedly preventable human suffering - a goal that, if validated, means an attempt to regulate all sources of life that produce such suffering, and thus all life itself, for human life is ultimately flawed. (Note neo-functionalist character of this: once the state is in one part of life, it finds it necessary to intrude into another; critique of the EU) 3. The Great Political Superstition That Parliament is not sovereign, as it does not presume to derive its power from God, but rather from the people, and the people, having many areas of private life on which they would not consent to obey the will of the majority, thus cannot have intended that the majority, as represented by Parliament, would govern all of life under the principle of majority rule. Rather, Parliament's purview is limited by the natural rights, which are few and which can be both philosophically and empirically arrived at: they govern the natural need of the individual to provide for himself the things necessary to sustain life, and to have those things protected; this implies at root a protection of life and property against the aggression of others, protections Spencer argues exist even in countries without formal legal systems. Parliament thus has a duty to protect the individual, both as a solitary figure and when he enters into voluntary contract with others. Beyond these protections, the power of Parliament is severely limited. (Direct attack on Benthamite ideas of governance: the problem is not a cost-benefit analysis between the immediate costs of some program and its immediate benefits, but the long-term effect of such programs on the overall health of the society and the society's ability to stay both prosperous and free. It is, for Spencer, the failure to observe this long-term problem, that is to blame for the expansion of parliamentary power without much outcry from the public, and, in line with (1) and (2), destined to end in the destruction of the free society.)

	Annote = {Several key points: 1. Securitization helps capital-scarce mortgage institutions lend more by allowing them to quickly convert assets to capital by packaging and selling them. Capital-poor mortgage banks in the US thus securitized mortgages, whereas capital-rich banks in Europe (esp on the Continent) did not need to do so. Why are banks in Europe capital rich? Can't be simply reserve requirements, or they would be equally constrained on loan volume. Something to do with available investment options? But why in an age of global finance would this be the case? Regulations that constrain use of that money? In that case rates would be expected to go down, increasing the attractiveness of home loans and thus show rising levels of home ownership. 2. Mortgage volumes are overdetermined: government sponsorship, credit conditions, securitization structures, availability of land (population density), and so forth are all implicated in demand for mortgage credit. 3. Bank-intermediated systems seem to show lower rates of home ownership than market-intermediated systems.},

@book{Wollstonecraft1892,
	Address = {London},
	Annote = {Threefold argument: 1. Theological Namely, that man and woman are created in God's image; that woman was, as in Genesis, formed from part of man; and that thus it is disrespectful to the Deity to treat woman (or for woman to treat herself) as a second-class citizen, content to show subservience to her husband and docility generally, in defiance of cultivating those virtues which God has indicated his creations should pursue: gratitude, service, humility, and so forth. These, for Wollstonecraft, can only be pursued if the woman is equal to the man; otherwise, humility is replaced with vanity in the pursuit of beauty, gratitude with subservience, and service with duty. 2. Scientific Second, that the nature/nurture difference has made women other than they can be, and that protestations that women are by nature deferential, concerned with trifles, uneven in emotion, uncurious in mind - ignore evidence which suggests that men, when left to the kind of lives led by most women, devoid of formal education and left to idleness all day, or (as with soldiers) encouraged to pursue esteem via acts of gallantry or display, that men too display the traits for which women are disparaged and thought incapable of lives like men. Thus 3. Political That it is harmful to the state to have half its population in effective servitude, especially when acknowledged that women can (as in (2)) demonstrate the same qualities of judgment, sense, leadership, cultivation, and intellect as men. Moreover, that, in securing women's civil rights, the country will benefit from 4. Social That the social order at present is unhealthy precisely because it tolerates people living in unequal status based on not ability or talent but on inherited or genetic precepts. For her, the damage done to the society by the subjegation of women is similar to that done by the empowerment of the ancestral lords and ladies: it puts a large number idle in pursuit of a better society, it undermines virtue with incentives for idleness, vanity, ignorance, and indulgence. Furthermore, it breaks down the marriage bond by forcing women to enter into marriage for financial reasons, thus diluting the durability of the marriage. Finally, should the husband die, it puts the surviving family at a disadvantage due to the woman's limited options for employment, forcing her either into dangerous or illicit work, or into hasty marriage to insure against financial disaster. Thus women, men, and society suffer for lack of woman's equality, particularly as it is manifested in the failure to educate women for independent life. She views all these social bonds - to her husband, to children, to the state - as stronger when made by women of cultivated judgment than when made by women of studied ignorance. },

@book{Marshall1992,
	Address = {London},
	Annote = {T.H. Marshall, Citizenship and Social Class Proposition: that the expansion of citizenship, and the shift of emphasis from rights to duties, has made citizenship into a tool for ameliorating social inequality, and thus put it at odds with the economic system it exists in, which requires such inequality to exist (insofar as social class is correlated with economic situation). Argument: Citizenship is chiefly composed of 3 elements: civic rights, political rights, and social rights, gained in approximately that order. See Piven et al (1993) on the role played by the civic rights grants in pacifying the politically unincorporated poor. Note the qualities of the civil rights vs. social rights development in a system of natural inequality (capitalism), not artificial inequality (feudalism) 1. Civil rights provided reasons to deny social rights - on the grounds that the individual was protected from predation in his role as an economic actor, and thus had equal prospect of ameliorating his social shortcomings 2. Civil rights guaranteed the preconditions for capitalism - by making each man his own agent, at least in theory, and relieving him from the bonds that would impede the functioning of a proper labor market. Note also - the granting of civil and political rights permitted the contestation of social rights; and it became clear in some cases that civil rights could not be fully enjoyed without confronting ongoing inequalities in social rights (e.g., the cost of hiring an attorney for contesting a claim in court, necessary to equality before the law, was not equally bearable by all classes). The 19th century saw the gradual expansion of the terms of citizenship to an ever-wider audience, but in phases. Civic rights were the first to be expanded (free speech, free worship, etc); political rights weren't fully enjoyed by all until the enfranchisement of both men and women after 1918; social rights were the last to develop, often under the pressure of civic rights - most notably in the role of collective bargaining in guaranteeing a living wage, which is normally understood as a social right. Marshall is close to Hayek in noting that, as social rights are expanded upon, it becomes difficult to determine where the appropriate boundary is between legitimate social rights and an ever-expanding definition that would use government intervention to break down all matters of class and economic inequality - socialism, in other words. Nevertheless, the movement is one of attempting to ameliorate one form of inequality - that of equality within the political community - without affecting another form - inequality within the economic system. It's unclear whether this feat can be pulled off, as when the third pillar of citizenship became fully manifested (social rights) it threw into question how much economic inequality would be tolerated by the political community. Four main questions: 1. Are there 2 forms of inequality (political and economic?) that are mutually exclusive? 2. How do measures intended to address poltiical inequality carry over to affect economic inequality? 3. What are the consequences of the shift in emphasis from duties of citizenship to rights? 4. Are there natural limits to the drive for social equality In brief: solving political inequality invariably has meant intruding on the realm of economic inequality, as it has required accounting for the effects of income on access to political measures (such as redress of greivance at the courts). In more extreme cases it has specifically adopted progressive tendencies in taxation intended to provide equality of access. The shift from duties to rights has sometimes led to a tendence to break with the delicate balance of responsibilities that enables the formation of the political community. The author cites trade unionism, which has often tried to enjoy both the civic right of collective bargaining and the political right of representation without complying with the duties of contract and peaceful negotiation. The implicit point is that rights have become highly enumerated and clear, while duties remain murkier. Thus it is easier for a person to assert their rights, but harder for the political community to call on them to fulfill their duties. There are natural limits to social equality insofar as they affect the ability of society to satisfy the promises it has made - in other words, economic inequality is probably necessary for the proper functioning of the capitalist system, insofar as it provides incentives for self-application and development and innovation. Whether this reality is reflected in the political understanding of social equality and its role in citizenship is another matter. Finally, the author correctly notes that the provision of services intended to correct for social inequality may have counterintuitive results. For instance, selective provision of healthcare - say, for the poor only - may in fact heighten one form of social inequality - class difference - while reducing another - access to care. Universal provision may reduce one form of social inequality - class difference and care access - while widening the economic gap between rich and poor. Finally, economic development, having expanded the array of goods and services available to those of modest means, has in part reduced economic inequality even as money income inequality has expanded. Tom Bottomore Proposition: that the idea of phases of citizenship that comes from Marshall's reading of 1800-1950 history may nto apply to late 20th century history due to the politics of welfare state retrenchment; that the concept of citizenship has been further diluted by the prsence of dual citizenship, which tends to heighten the emphasis on rights while weakening that on duties (for how can you own duties to two political communities equally); and that changes to the environment and the developing world as a result of the economic progress of the developed world since WWII may force changes to the social rights of citizenship founded on a rethinking of the production paradigm. Welfare state retrenchment: social rights were expanded in Europe after WWII for a variety of reasons, and to a variety of degrees, up until the 1970s. The slowing of economic growth and the process of convergence with the US put pressure on welfare state budgets and threw into question whether Marshall's original goal - provision of social right without interfering with the market - had been violated. Thus the 1980s had seen welfare state retrenchment, often through a rhetoric that portrayed those reliant on the welfare state as having violated duties of citizenship - namely, the duty to be self-sufficient and find remunerative employment. Most acute in Britain and the US, it occurred to lesser degree on the Continent, though the Nordic and Scandanavian countries saw more reconfiguration than retrenchment. Dual citizenship: particularly problematic for the EU, in which citizens implicitly carry 2 citizenships even as the identity of the nation-state survives. How rights and responsibilities should be apportioned in this instance is unclear. Environmental and international considerations: social rights to date have been concerned with how to divide up the proceeds of growth - that is, how much should winners win, and losers receive along the way, as the economy grows. It's not much concerned with how to divide up stocks of capital, wealth, land, etc. - and attempts to do so have generally been disastrous. But what if environmental damage makes societies rethink growth (some vague stuff about ``social product'' here)? And what if it's decided that the North owes the South something (though since this was written in 1992, the South has done better and the developing world - specifically India and China - very well). Reaction: Marshall's essay makes sense. The 40-year review is less interesting. It offers no sense of perspective that the post-1989 welfare state retrenchment in Europe was necessary as a precursor to building an economy that could support restructured social rights; nor does it reflect on whether the unions had critically abandoned the duties of citizenship in Britain during the late 1970s, to the point where the social rights then enjoyed became unsustainable. The problems he discusses exist in a much longer postwar social and economic history than his review of them would have you believe. Nor is there much consideration in either essay of whether some of these rights are internally inconsistent. Can the provision of social rights undermine the guarantee of civic and political right? Is progressive taxation, for instance, in tension with the idea of equal treatment under the law? Does guaranteeing the right to, say, housing frustrate the ability of others to exercise their right to economic self-determination, insofar as the taxes or other methods used to fund the first right constrict the ability to achieve the second? And, as Marshall notes, what about mobility vs. inequality? If inequality exists, but is relatively dynamic on an intergenerational basis, then is it unjust? (See recent Emmanuel Saez paper on this). And finally, why have attempts to redistribute the means of production (vs. the ends) always ended up in catastrophe, and what does that mean for the very fuzzy language on ``social product'' rolled out by Bottomore? See every Communist country, plus modern Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc. If history does provide a guide here, it is to suggest that a future of slow or no growth in deference to environmental issues will produce major social conflict and potential mass impoverishment - social equality achieved through economic destruction. },

@book{Gerschenkron1962,
	Address = {Cambridge},
	Annote = {pp5-30 Proposition: that the order in which a country industrializes vis a vis its neighbors determines how it industrializes - namely, what role the state and other institutions play in the development of the industrial base, and how those institutions survive past the point at which their role in industrialization has run its course. Argument: Germany, in particular, faced the problem of late industrialization compared with Britain. Unlike Britain, it did not enjoy a prolonged period of capital accumulation aided by the development, early on, of low-capitalization industries like textile mfg. Rather, political pressures forced it into a period of rapid industrialization in cutting-edge industries (notably steel), that required large capital stocks, and, where possible, the minimization of intra-industry competition. The banks developed a role in making this possible: first, by supplying the scale of capital needed for large plant development, and second, by dictating the terms on which that capital would be available, terms which included strictures on intra-industry competition. Thus Germany developed very tight relationships between bank and factory unseen in Britain, relationships that persisted beyond the period of initial industrialization and characterize the German banking sector today. Russia is the counter-example: as it industrialized even later, consequence of the persistence of serfdom until 1861, it demanded an entirely different level of state involvement, which the Bolsheviks provided. Thus while the Soviets engaged in rather brutal methods unloved by the populace, they nonetheless provided a needed service: the state-level coordination of capital formation for an underindustrialized society. Counterargument: Soviet industrialization was a disaster in the medium term. It proved entirely unadaptable. (Would the same have been true of Germany without the capital stock destruction of WWII?). Is there a limit to this argument, insofar as very late industrializing nations face a dilemma between significant state involvement and the political and social costs of such a thing?},

@book{Volkov2002,

	Annote = {Ch. 4., ``Bandits and Capitalism'' Proposition: that the very act of engaging in political-economic activity takes criminal gangs such as existed in early 1990s Russia and transforms them from racketeering organizations dependent on the use of violence to what could be called legitimate business organizations, more interested in investment and community relations and political influence than the criminal acts which got them started. Argument: Case-study based, on 3 different Russian criminal gangs and their key personnel, all of whom (if they weren't killed in the chaos of mid-1990s Russia) all of whom have attempted in various ways to transform themselves from criminal gangs to quasi-legitimate businesses. The key factor in each transition has been the realization that investment in the businesses under their ``protection'' yields more long-term results than milking the businesses for short-term gains. Thus those gangs which survived to make this transformation are those which took a long-term view and tolerated business independence and cultivation, compared with those more interested in the use of violence to achieve short-term profits. Counterargument: what's the prevalence? If you say that this is true for your case studies, what is the count of such gangs-turned-businessmen, compared with those criminal gangs still outstanding? The author argues implicitly that the Russian economy has undergone something of a transformation. It's not legitimate by any means - but it has aspects of legitimacy that can't be denied. True, but what if this is 5\% of the population? What's the underlying activity of violent gang behavior and influence in the marketplace? Are the quasi-legitimate gangs simply priviledged in controlling certain ``commanding heights,'' and the rest of hte economy is left open? },

@article{Boyle2003,
	Annote = {Proposition: that the pre ``digital age'' concept of intellectual property protection (as an appropriate monopoly given to the creator as incentive for creation) is an inadequate way to think about how IP law should be adapted to deal with the opportunities and problems created by digital technology. Argument: that mere extension of present IP ideas to cover the digital realm (or expansion of property rights without modification to cover the public realm) may cause real harm in the long run to the ultimate end goals of IP law: namely, its balance between the goods derived from the public release of knowledge, and the goods derived from ensuring a proper reward to the creator of said knowledge. Cites Jefferson, Macauley, Madison as being wary of the monopoly power granted by copyright or patent. It was understood that the monopoly restriction of access to protected works was a balance between the evils of monopoly protection (particularly given the strong externalities of public knowledge) and the evils of unremunerative invention. Moved to today, such ideas seem quaint in the public debate. The dangers of monopoly have been forgotten, the value of property as property is generally assumed to be very large. Thus the concern about copyright extension, limits on fair use, employment of substantial monitoring systems to police fair use, and the like, are accepted as necessary by the public even as their benefits may only accrue to the financial interests which hold the property. What alternatives? 1. ``Free'' as in free access under common terms. See the GPL - allows open access so long as the terms of the license are followed, which requires offering free access to works derived from work covered by the GPL. Not ``free'' as in costless, but ``free'' as in prescribing the same access conditions for everyone. (Larry Lessig) 2. Free as in costless. (Benkler). What public domain? Lessig's definition - that of open access under common terms - best describes the GPL. The idea is that the commons, insofar as IP is concerned, is both non-excludable and non-rival (everyone can have access, and can do so without reducing the amount of access available to everyone else.) NOTE: Not sure I buy his analogy. Are there points of diminishing return, as in his roads example? Too many cars on the road (too much access) decreases the utility of the road for everyone. COMMENT: 1. For music, seems obvious. Industry missed the boat on the digital revolution, ignored what their customers wanted, found that their customers could now have it anyway, and are now fighting a rear-guard action to preserve the old model, using government as a tool for business. For software, less clear. How to prove violations, outside of expensive litigation? See SCO vs. Redhat. SCO will probably lose, which is good, but at a very high cost in lawyers' fees, etc. 2. Would argue contra Lessig that ``tragedy of the commons'' is still very possible. 3. Not clear what the author's conclusions are. The public domain is important, IP law is being exploited for lack of discussion over what constitutes a public domain in the digital era, etc. But piracy remains a serious problem, not only at home but also abroad. There are reasonable legal limits to the openness of information. Does this mean we allow patents for actual innovation, and copyright for actual creativity, but restrict both in cases of ``data'' - genetic information in naturally-occurring species, for instance? },

@article{Mosley2005,
	Annote = {Note: remember Mosley's argument on the metrics used by the financial industry to evaluate national economic policy. Developed countries were evaluated on a narrow set of macroeconomic criteria, while developing countries were evaluated on both macroeconomic and microeconomic criteria due to a perceived higher risk of default. Thus developed countries maintained policy flexibility so long as they satisfied a narrow set of criteria. Propostion: that the ``race-to-the-bottom'' lacks empirical support despite its persistence in the public and policy dialogue, and that globalization has left states, developed states in particular, considerable room to move when devising policies to adjust for the risks imposed by greater trade and financial openness. Argument: similar to Weiss, Mosley argues that a very narrow set of criteria are important to investors: government debt, inflation, interest rates. Policy convergence is seen across countries on inflation, debt, and interest rates (fiscal and monetary policy generally) but not on the structure of spending. Regulatory climates appear relatively benign, as do other forms of financial incentive (see Schulz in this regard, on FDI). The result is that states have a fairly substantial discretion to use when choosing policies, policies which may deliver significant political benefit with relatively small economic cost. Furthermore, the ``sacrifice of sovereignty'' problem cuts both ways. In a perfect market, you would expect that states' ability to borrow on world capital markets would depend solely on their credit qualifications. But evidence shows that in times of great liquidity, borrowing conditions ease even for high-risk states; the reverse is true in times of tight liquidity. Thus the global markets aren't exclusively disciplinary. Why the persistence of the RTB argument: either (1) that it benefits policy or scholarly goals with ideological predispositions to support the its implications (namely, that we have to lower taxes / cut spending / deregulate / cut the welfare state if we're to stay competitive), or (2) that it has a utility for governments trying to correct for past mistakes without admitting fault (it wasn't us, it was the market, now we're going to change to perform better). Questions: 1. Again, how to deal with the different domestic outcomes. Sweden is one thing; what about the major economies (France, Germany, Italy) that have paid for persistent social welfare with high unemployment and anemic growth until very recently? A post-1989 adjustment problem, a problem of bad national policy choices (just be like the Swedes and all will be well) or something more serious? 2. How to deal with wage outcomes? German unemployment was solved in part with significant wage restraint by the unions; US low unemployment has come at the cost of jobs (something like 2/3 of those who lost a job and found a new one did so at a lower starting wage...not sure about what happened from there). },

	Annote = {Proposition: that globalization has expanded the set of possible political-economic configurations of the state, and in the process has given government more, not less, flexibility. Argument: in brief, that the most globalized states tend also to be the most developed ones, with the largest welfare states, and that those welfare states, and the role of the state in administering them, have remained through several subsequent waves of reform. What has happened is not elimination of the welfare state, but adjustment of it to achieve the same ends in economic conditions very different from those of its founding. And, that while states have reduced their overall levels of industrial policy, they now employ it more effectively, such that (1) they tend to sponsor adjustment mechanisms, like R\&D and venture capital, rather than perpetuate fading industries, and (2) they use their power within multinational organizations (WTO, etc) to ensure that their future economies will be protected - giving up rights to tariffs, say, in exchange for IP protection. Thus the state is still important, albeit in changing ways, and stands to become moreso. Questions: 1. How to account for the fact that some states bear much higher direct costs, e.g. unemployment, for perpetuating their welfare systems? The German and French cases come to mind. And it's not just a function of unification, see Siebert. 2. The author evaluates state power as a matter of program survival and spending levels - but consequences remain vital, and here she's ignored. Could the 20-year timeline she works on simply not be enough? One might have said that Britain of the 19th century did just fine in the ``global'' economy despite its financial structure and tendency to export capital rather than fund domestic investment. But that had disastrous consequences in the longer run. (e.g. 1860 vs. 1900-1910 and the interwar years and beyond). },

@article{Watson2005,
	Annote = {Proposition: The ``coordination problem'' is not solved implicitly by moving to a market economy. In other words, that the market economy cannot, without external, non-economic help, come to an equilibrium of buyers, sellers, and prices, in a way that makes the system self-sustaining. Argument: that post-Smithian economic theorists (Walras, Schumpeter) have tried to excise the ``moral philosophy'' argument contained in Smith from economic theory, in the hope of presenting purely economic proofs that economies naturally solve the ``coordination'' problem - namely, how prices bring buyers and sellers into equilibrium; and that they have failed to do so, in the process misreading Smith (Schumpeter) or giving up entirely and resorting to deus ex machine (Walras). Note to self: read Smith's ``Theory of Moral Sentiments.'' Three sections: 1. Schumpeter. Watson argues that Schumpeter willfully misreads Smith in an attempt to get out of the problem Smith points out inherent in market economics: that to achieve the market's gains, individuals must behave self-interestedly; but to establish, and propagate the market, they must behave with ``propriety,'' or in other words not try to defraud their fellow capitalists. Smith doesn't resolve the tension between the two, and Watson argues that Schumpeter resolves it by ignoring the ``propriety'' dilemma. 2. Walras. Watson points out that in the first three editions of Walras' magnum opus on political economy, he grapples with the mechanism by which the economy comes into equilibrium - how, starting from a diverse set of buyers, sellers, and goods, to all individuals arrive at a set of prices and transactions by which the market clears? This is unclear in the first three volumes. Walras wants to assume the market exists (contra Smith, who assumes that individuals have to build it), and so lacks human agency for figuring out the adjustment mechanism. And by volume 4, he has eliminated this problem, invoking the metaphor of an auctioneer to describe the process - but, as Watson points out, the auctioneer is a kind of deus ex machina, not originally existing inside the market, who magically has access to all information and all participants. 3. Smith. Watson argues that Smith, when read as both ``Wealth'' and ``Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' concludes that there is no a priori reason to believe the market naturally reaches equilibrium, without the assistance of some outside intervention - government or similar - that sets up structures to support the clearing process. This is because pure market economics provides significant incentive for those with specialized knowledge - merchants and manufacturers - to collude to set prices, which while a technique with short-run horizons nevertheless fulfills their goals as self-interested individuals. And, since in Smith's world, societies survive that are just, a society that fulfills the requirements for market clearing will not survive. note for Smith: a properly functioning economy is one in which no one actor has power over another. Divergence between the natural and market price is evidence of a power asymmetry - either from the buyer's side (either through monosony, or an overproduction mistake by the mfg that requires liquidation) or from the seller's (moments of extreme scarcity, as in emergency, or through monopoly power). },

@book{Polanyi2001,
	Annote = {Ch. 3, ``Habitation vs. Improvement.'' Title taken from the fundamental tension between the pre-Enclosure serf and the lord seeking to benefit from Enclosure: how to manage the latter without destroying the former? Proposition: the Industrial Revolution managed a miraculous expansion in the availability of manufactured goods at the cost of immiserising masses of people. The history of the mid-Industrial-Revolution to present is in trying to find ways of making the pace of economic change implicit in such a revolution bearable, so that its excesses don't bear other excesses (fascism, etc). Argument: The central argument restated: that the IR caused massive social dislocation even as it created unprecedented material wealth, largely because the IR did not see the kind of Tudor/Stuart reaction to the Enclosures until very late. The mechanism of that dislocation is found in the commodification of heretofore unsellable items - land, labor, and capital - as a prerequisite for the ability to manage large industrial enterprises. Managing the dislocation caused by this commodification requires government intervention in markets. The 19th century thus sees a gradual march away from the free-market ethos that the IR began in, as states tried to buffer the effects of industrialization. Ch. 6, ``The Self-Regulating Market and the Fictitious Commodities'' Proposition: that the pure market economy as advocated by its theorists required that everything in that economy be open to sale, and that all income in the economy be earned through the sale of a commodity. This had substantial social effects. Argument: that the conditions of the market economy required the commodification of three unnatural commodities - land, labor, and capital - both for the proper functioning of the mercantile sector, and for the proper functioning of the industrial sector. The latter was mandated by the much larger amounts of capital that were now required to produce commodities for sale - thus requiring that the capitalist have much greater control over his enterprise, control he achieved by being able to buy and sell any part of it, including the labor that ran it and the land it existed on. This was new in human history. Land had been regulated first by feudalism, then by regulations governing the Enclosure. Labor had been regulated by the guild system. Capital had in the past played only a minor role (and, until commodity money, had been of limited mobility and liquidity). But market economies demanded that the regulation of land, labor, and capital transactions be removed. In doing so, market economics removed the protections that in the past had made economic dislocation bearable. The contrast is to the Enclosure Movement, which in Spain had gone unregulated, resulting in the decimation of cropland by sheep. The Tudor / Stuart decision to regulate the Enclosures prevented such a fate for England. But Industrialisation had no such protective anti-movement, hence human suffering was much greater. Thus his core argument: that the 19th century extension of markets to nearly every corner of human life was matched with a restriction of markets in these three ``fictitious economies.'' This ``double transformation'' provided the means for the society to enjoy the gains of the market without falling victim to its excesses and their inevitable backlash. Ch. 7, ``Speenhamland'' The rise and fall of Speenhamland forms the narrative for the final acquiescence to the labor market. Speenhamland tried to provide a guaranteed support to the laborer as he sold his labor on the market; but in doing so, it set essentially a wage ceiling, and slowly reduced workers to paupers and industrialists to reliance on the state for wage payment. In the end, it proved more destructive for workers to live under Speenhamland than under a pure labor market, as they enjoyed none of the benefits of the expanded production of a market economy but many of its humiliations. Polanyi points out that the Speenhamland law was an attempt to circumvent the full reality of the industrial society that the market demanded: namely, that everything must be bought and sold, labor included, and that income must derive from this alone. Curious note: Polanyi thinks that, had unionization been legal, Speenhamland might have worked. Then, the wage ceiling might have worked as a wage floor, if workers could have jointly bargained for wages above those of the state. But unions weren't legal until the 1870s. Finally: Society: he argues that ``society'' as we know it essentially originated with the separation of the world into political and economic spheres. It became where the two met - and where the decisions were made as to how much sway one or the other would have. **How society would cope with the transformations of economics dictated the demands it would put on politics. ** vz. Thatcher, ``there's no such thing as society.'' Ch. 12, ``Birth of the Liberal Creed'' Two assertions: first, that there was no concerted movement in the 19th century towards collectivism - that the regulation of hte market was almost always and everywhere a pragmatic response to the disruption of society that industrialization and market economics wrought. Second, that the liberal movement, lacking evidence to support their claims that a collectivist movement with alterior motives disrupted the proper functioning of hte market economy, instead adopted a theory of "covert action" against the free operation of the market. Polanyi notes that both he and his liberal adversaries see a "double movement." But his (in which market regulation is a natural social response to the disruption of society by marketization) sees the response as society-wide; the liberal response sees only a conspiracy to disrupt market function run by specific groups (typically Marxist intellectuals and a colluding working class). Ch. 14, ``Markets and Man'' A exposition of the role of the various societies and social movements (Owenism, etc) that sprang up in England in the post-Poor Law years of 1834-50 or so. Polayi argues these are essentially social, more than economic, movements - and in some cases offered lower wages than comparable factory jobs, but under better living conditions and without the wholesale destruction of community that Polanyi credits to the IR. Moreover, he notes that this was a widespread movement that had interest from a wide variety of sectors - not least Bentham, who subscribed to Owen's program. Also an account of the problems of poltiical representation - namely, the lack of universal suffrage - that were at the heart of the Chartist movement of hte late 1840s. The failure of this movement meant the near-term lack of a real popularly constituted state for Britain.But it did mark a truly cross-class political movement, with support from the bourgeious as well as the working classes. Finally, he notes that the social problems of the IR in Britain were unique - no comparable set of social movements is seen on the Continent - because of the unique set of social conditions that pertained in Britain pre-IR. British cottagers and pesants were a unique social class with specific priviledges and rights; the Enclosure movement was part of this, because it made the working class part of an economic system. The IR, by destroying that way of life, degraded those who lived it. But on the Continent, the life of a peasant was crude indeed, and industrialization coupled to urbanization was refinement for those who'd grown up in the wheat fields of Prussia or the vineyards of France (NB - does this follow? Or was the Continent faster to respond, as in Bismarck's pensions scheme?). Thus Continental movements were largely for protection against the problems of factory life - workman's comp, pensions, etc - rather than the social effects of industrialization - Speenhamland, Owen's communitarian model of industrialisation, etc - and thus lacked some of the despiration. Note also his critique of Mises: that the conditions of the market economy offered the worker the choice between selling his labor with no control over to whom, at what price or location, and for what duration; or starvation. That not being a choice, labor lacked for real choices in the supposed ``market'' economy. Ch. 15. ``Markets and Land'' Proposition: Market capitalism required dismantling the feudal attachment to the land, in order that both the workers and the land tied up in feudalism could be repositioned in the market. As with commodification of labor, this destroyed a standing social order, with significant consequences. Unlike with labor, it resulted in a strange alliance of farmers and landed gentry. Argument: as with labor, land had to be governed by sanctity of contract. That contract had to be private, and so the reciprocal duties ascribed to feudal organizations of land had to be dealt away with. This meant, however, the breakdown of a social order that depended on the persistance of a relationship to the land - the village, factory, town, school, etc around which human life congregated. The 18th century after the 1840s saw a backlash against these reforms. In Britain, it took the form of restrictions on land use, pollution laws, building of parks for workmen's access to nature, and so forth. On the Continent, it took the form of agricultural protectionism, in which the landed gentry (who Polanyi believes had lost all other function) formed a vanguard with the farmers and peasants to protect a rural way of life through a rejection of free trade. This ultimately took the form of postwar agrarianism and outright protectionism, courtest of the rise of the working classes to power. With full suffrage in place courtest of the mass suffering of the war, Polanyi credits fascism as a response to the very real chance that the now-empowered working classes might just intervene in the market to undo the capitalist revolution of the first half of the 18th century. This was not Bolshevism - these people were inside the government and generally despised the Bolsheviks - but was nonetheless anticapitalist in sentiment. That the bourgeious formed the vanguard of fascism (speciically, the lower-middle class) as an ``anti-communist'' political effort suggests that it was an anti-working-class effort directed at stopped the erosion of capitalist structures. Doing so became part of the destruction of the standing social order organized around village life. As with the workers, those chiefly occupied in the land - the farmers and peasants - would form the backbone of a protectionist sentiment that sought to preserve the land against the Ch 16. "Markets and Productive Organization" A version of Chapter 15, but for money. Polanyi views money, along with land and labor, as the essential "fictive commodities" of the industrial revolution. As commodities (which, in the most pure sense, were precious metals) the commodification of money had to follow the commodification of everything else: the quantity of money, and its worth, now became fixed to the quantity of other commodities; relative prices became the determinant of the value of money. This maintained the valu eof prices and kept profits and investment predictable. But this also created problems - namely, for significant deflation in times of economic contraction (and, under the gold standard, for contagion). Hume's theory of money recognized the utility of deflation for restoring balance to market economies, but did not confront the possible social costs (and economic costs) of such deflation. The evolution of the system away from a fixed gold standard towards a system of central banking (which loosed the bonds on the money supply, albeit to varying degrees depending on its implementation) and later by a system of fiat money loosely based on Gold (Bretton Woods). However, the transition away from commodity money did not come without costs - namely, the real costs exacted by a commodity money system in the nations less observant of it than the US and UK (namely, France and Germany) and the extreme political responses those costs engendered (notably fascism, which overruled the Reichsbank's historical emphasis on tight money and practised the most extreme form of Keynesianism yet observed). },

@techreport{Cheung2007,
	Abstract = { 1 China -- and Chinese economic policy -- has loomed large on the global economic stage in recent years. Yet, even as arguments over the appropriateness of the size of the Chinese trade balance and the value of the Chinese currency continue, there is substantial debate in academic and policy circles surrounding what are the determinants of these variables. Interestingly, there are very few studies that simultaneously assess the Chinese exchange rate and trade/current account balance. This is partly an outcome of the peculiar characteristics of the Chinese economy. In this study, we attempt to inform the debate over the interactions between the exchange rate and the current account by recourse to two key methodologies. First we identify the equilibrium real exchange rate from the standpoint of cross-country studies. Second, we attempt to obtain a more precise estimate of Chinese trade elasticities, both on a multilateral and bilateral (with the U.S.) basis. In doing so, we hope to transcend the current limited debate based upon rules-of-thumb. To anticipate our results, we obtain several interesting results. First, the CNY is substantially below the value predicted by our cross country estimates. The economic magnitude of the mis-alignment is substantial -- on the order of 50\% in log terms. However, we also find that the misalignment is typically not statistically significant, in the sense of being more than one standard error away from the conditional mean. Second, we find that Chinese multilateral trade flows do respond to relative prices -- as represented by a trade weighted exchange rate -- but that that relationship is not always precisely estimated. In addition, the direction of effects is different than expected a priori. For instance, we find that Chinese ordinary imports rise in response to a yuan depreciation. However, Chinese exports do appear to respond to yuan depreciation in the expected manner, as long as a supply variable is included. So, in this sense, Chinese trade is not exceptional. Furthermore, Chinese trade with the U.S. appears to behave in a standard manner -- especially after the expansion in the Chinese manufacturing capital stock is accounted for. Thus, the China-US trade balance should respond to real exchange rate and relative income movements in the anticipated manner. However, in neither the case of multilateral or bilateral trade flows should one expect quantitatively large effects arising from exchange rate changes. And of course, our results are not informative with regard to the question of how a change in the CNY/USD exchange rate would affect the overall US trade deficit. Finally, we highlight the fact that considerable uncertainty surrounds both our estimates of CNY misalignment and the responsiveness of trade flows to movements in exchange rates and output levels. In particular, our results for trade elasticities are sensitive to econometric specification, accounting for supply effects, and the inclusion of time trends. },

@techreport{Crafts2001,
	Abstract = {A growth accounting methodology is used to compare the contributions to growth in terms of capital-deepening and total factor productivity growth of three general-purpose technologies, namely, steam in Britain during 1780-1860, electricity and information and communications technology in the United States during 1899-1929 and 1974-2000, respectively. The format permits explicit comparison of earlier episodes with the results for ICT obtained by Oliner and Sichel. The results suggest that the contribution of ICT was already relatively large before 1995 and it is suggested that the true productivity paradox is why economists expected more sooner from ICT. },

	Abstract = {Since the debate about the importance of social capital and civil society for the quality of democracy began, Scandinavia has caused problems. Observers have been bewildered by an allegedly paradoxical coexistence of a wealth of social capital and extensive welfare-state arrangements. Some theorize that large welfare states make engagement in voluntary associations unnecessary, making the production of social capital more difficult. However, empirical research shows Scandinavia to have comparatively high levels of social capital. To solve this paradox, the authors address how the causal mechanism between variation in the design of welfare-state institutions and social capital works. The empirical analysis, based on Swedish survey data, suggests that the specific design of welfare-state policies matters for the production of social capital. Contacts with universal welfare-state institutions tend to increase social trust, whereas experiences with needs-testing social programs undermine it. The policy implication is that governments, by designing welfare-state institutions, can invest in social capital. },

	Abstract = {The strength of the Swedish Social Democracy implies that Sweden is a critical case for theory about social capital. First, what is the relation between the encompassing welfare programs and social capital? Second, what is the effect on civil society of the neo-corporatist relations between the government and major interest organizations? Using both archival and survey data, the result is that the sharp decline in social capital since the 1950s in the United States has no equivalence in Sweden. This has to do with the specific way in which social programs have been institutionalized. Social capital may be caused by how government institutions operate and not by voluntary associations. },

@article{Lapidus1998,
	Annote = {The author argues that the war in Chechnya was deliberately orchestrated by Russia from Moscow, that it did not represent the outcome of failed attempts at non-violent conflict resolution, and that in this Moscow was aided and abetted by a West more concerned about supporting the Yeltsin government against perceived communist/nationalist threats than about supporting the evolution of legitimate political institutions. The result was a war of miscalculation on all levels: by Moscow, which seriously underestimated the opposition forces and thus was dragged into a bloody standoff; by Washington, which mischaracterized the threat to Yeltsin and so failed to bring an end to a war that ultimately weakened him; by the UN, which missed signals for an oncoming war. Major factors: 1. The weakness of institutions. Post-Soviet Moscow had not consolidated central control over major foreign policy and military institutions. As a result, nationalist/communist elements could turn these institutions against Yeltsin, ensuring the presentation of a specific interpretation of the conflict (e.g. the dissolution of Russia at the hands of a criminal band) and specific solutions (military action). 2. The misunderstanding of the ethnic/cultural situation. Lacking real knowledge about the history of Chechnya (including mass deporation under Stalin and repatriation under Khruschev), the West misunderstood what was going on in Chechnya. That, and a missed link between the Russian portrayal of Chechnya, and Russian neo-imperialist attitudes more generally. 3. The priorities of the West. Moscow was a critical partner in NATO enlargement, Bosnia, nuclear non-proliferation, and other security initiatives. Yeltsin had a close relationship with Clinton. Thus in this context, with Yeltsin perceived to be weakening, the West chose Moscow over a confrontation with the Russians on Chechnya. 4. The Russian framing of the debate in the West. Portraying the Chechens as criminals / terrorists / insurgents fit with the Western perception of the situation and went largely unquestioned by major governments. Likewise, the Western concern that the loss of Chechnya could spark a dismantling of Russia was reinforced by official statements from Moscow. Prospects: 1. Lack of a negotiated settlement has (a) destabilized Chechnya internally, for it lacks legitimacy either as an autonomous state or as an independent country, and (b) made further negotiation difficult. 2. Settlement of territorial issues is unlikely given the proto-nationalist climate in Moscow. Economic options are perhaps more likely. 3. The West now has little influence, since it did not involve itself in the beginning and did not support organizations like the OSCE which attempted to involve themselves in the middle, to Russian opposition. },

	Annote = {Georgia faced several problems at the outset of economic reform: 1. A lack of any prior experience in running its own economy, due to 200 years of relations with Moscow / St. Petersburg 2. A running war with Abkhazia on its territory, disrupting the reform process 3. The lack of prior existing financial and political institutions, which had to be built even as the existing economy was being reformed 4. The resolution of the Abkhaz war, which cut Georgia off from its traditional Russian markets Those problems were exacerbated by slow and misguided reform: 1. Politics took precedence over economics in the 1990-1991 period, delaying crucial reforms while other post-Soviet states moved on 2. Freeing of price controls was soon followed by their re-imposition: goods quickly flowed out of hte country 3. Land reform distributed somewhat productive collective land to wholly unprepared individual farmers who lacked the capital to make the smaller farms productive. Georgia's self-sufficiency and its export potential dropped. 4. Georgian independence did not come with control of its money supply, depriving it of a key policy tool 5. Government revenues routinely exceeded government budgets, causing a net contractionary effect Later attempts at reform, 1994-1995, only made this worse: 1. A substitute currency was issued, but the ruble remained; the economy became dollarized while the new currency was inflated out of use. 2. Hyperinflation resulted from subsidization of agriculture and industry 3. International trade by barter opened the economy to corruption and resulted in huge public debts from subsidizing goods needed for export barter. 1995-1998: IMF intervention and some reform 1. But voucher privatization was corrupt and resulted in the looting of industry for saleable capital goods 2. Little democratic institutional reform; Georgia was de facto an autocracy from 1995 onward after consolidation of the roles of head of state and chief executive in one office. This would not change until the Rose Revolution of 2004 3. Governmental needs to fund pensions and wages led to borrowing at very high rates - 24\%+ - that increased with each new bond issuance. This crowded producers out of the market and made private investment impossible. 4. Mismatch between laws and institutions: e.g. bankruptcy, which is enshrined in law but effectively nonexistent in practice. 5. Role of law in making survival a matter of corruption - thus embedding corrupt practices in society 6. Energy sector burdened with debt to meet its obligations to the European energy markets, but now cannoy borrow effectively. Conclusion: Pre-2004 was largely a loss to Georgia. And the legacy of this time - heavy indebtedness, embedded corruption, unproductive industry, and a malfunctioning government - will bear on the country despite its new reform-oriented leaders. },

The result was mass deportation, privation, and genocide to remove the most troublesome populations, as in Chechnya, Georgia, and other areas of the southern USSR. -Khruschev reversed the Russification policy initially, as a way of legitimating his power and purging the Stalinist elites. But the contradiction remained: nationalism was incompatible with the Party-centric structure of the USSR. Thus the later period saw a return to centralized rule and restriction of autonomy. -Brehznev turned the ethnic states into clients through favoritism and exploitation of a client-patron relationship with the elites of each state. Communism began to fall victim to the demands of Soviet cohesion. -Gorbachev returned to the idea of political pluralism, and with it, reduced the role of ideological rhetoric.

@article{King2001a,
	Annote = {Question: What is the relationship between war, business, and state-building in the Post-Soviet Caucasus? Wars of the Soviet succession:Nagorno-Karabakh,Transnistria,South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Chechnya, Tajikistan, all having run their course by the middle of the decade except for Chechnya. But territorial conflicts remain, though not expressed in violence - how to explain the lack of violence despite the persistence of conflict? Two theses: (1) that the wars of Soviet succession were relatively successful in state-making, and (2), that the disputes have attained an equilibrium because of interests in maintaining the status quo, despite its unsatisfactory elements. Theories on propagation of civil war: (1) Ethnic/nationalist sentiments prevent negotiation on grounds of avoiding 'national betrayal' that get stronger as war losses go on, and (2) wars are profitable for powerful interests on each side, even if they aren't good for the belligerents as a whole. In the last case, post-victory attempts to build institutions are corrupted by the perpetuation of these powerful interests within the political landscape, reducing politics to a zero-sum game. But - in the Caucasus, this has occurred with the collusion of central governments, not just the misbehavior of elites, essentially co-opting otherwise separatist groups into building the postwar, multi-ethnic states that have resulted in the region. Ex 1: Armenia-Azerbaijan war over the status of Karabakh, an autonomous part of Armenia during the Soviet era which was ethnically Azeri. Fought between 1989-1995 to a status quo with Armenia in control of Karabakh. Ex 2: Moldova-Transnistria war over Transnistrian resistance to Moldovan separatism (where the Transnistrian portion of Moldova wished to stay with Russia due to strong economic connections). Fought between 1990-1992 to a stalemate where Transnistria is a protectorate of Russia but no formal treaty exists. Ex 3: Georgia-Abkhaz war over Georgian control of the formerly autonomous republic. Fought from 1992-1994 to a stalemate where Abkhaz is formally autonomous but with significant Russian support, with negotiations contributing little to final status. Ex 4: Georgia-South Ossetian war over the Ossetians' resistance to becoming part of Georgia given ethnic and linguistic differences. Fought to a standstill between 1989-1992, leading to final status negotiations via the OSCE. Why no final settlements in any of these conflicts despite pressure from the OSCE and Russia? Answer: because the longer no settlement is reached, the longer the de facto states in the contested regions have to solidify their (largely effective) control, and the longer interested elites have to take advantage of the political structures for other reasons. Economics - the persistence of local governments in contested regions has allowed economic rent-taking, as in customs duties, local control of large plants (like Transnistrian steel), and local control of agricultural output. Thus new interests have arisen to support autonomy rather than final settlement. Russia has expressed standing interests in the autonomous regions, part of its ongoing disputes with the Caucasus nations. Security Services have given aid to the regions, withdrawals of Russian troops from the Caucasus have been predicated on resolution of the autonomous areas, and Russia maintains strong economic links that give the areas sustainance. Visa policy also favors the regions compared to their Caucasus adversaries. ``Governments'' in the autonomous regions have begun coordinating to limit the influence of the Caucasus nations in any of them - consolidated foreign policy gives them strength. And most of the parties involved benefit from the unresolved status: -The Russians, as a pawn in their political battles against the former Soviet republics in the Caucasus -Certain elites within the Caucasus republics, who have gained political power either from the conflict itself or from exploitation of the economic opportunities implicit in weak states and humanitarian aid -The autonomous regions, who would lose power if incorporated into another nation or if forced to become more legitimate. Meanwhile, these pseudo-states have become centers of traficking in arms, drugs, people, and goods across Europe. And the embedded interests make it difficult for even the most objective, disinterested negotiator to resolve the problem. Thus the problems of these areas aren't just security or strategic - they are economic and political as well, embedded in the quasi-settlements of the postwar era. },

	Annote = {Cornell argues that, while Azerbaijan has not traditionally been a haven for radical Islam (and in fact was among the leading secular Muslim nations in its region, and rather pro-Western), the signs of an increasing role for political Islam are unmistakeable. His argument is that Azerbaijan lived in an area of religious convergence - Christian to the West, Muslim to the South, Buddist and Zoroastrian to the East - that meant that its religious identity was uniquely Azeri, rather than identified with any one center. During the period of Russian colonialism and then Soviet control, this religious identity faded away under forced aethism, but has returned since 1989. The problem is that what has returned has largely been Islam, though not initially radicalized. Rather, the West's handling of the war in Karabakh and its punishment of Azerbaijan despite it not being the aggressor, combined with the war in Iraq and other problematic relations, have tempted Azeris to adopt the more theocratic idea of Islam. While not yet a majority, the potential role of Azerbaijan as a potential point of Islamic radicalism should not be underestimated. },

	Annote = {Basic thesis: the role of the military in the post-Soviet states should be considered in a more nuanced fashion than it has been to date. War has been relatively successful - 11 or 12 of the ethnic wars have been won by the insurgent ethnicity. But coups have not. Standing armies have behaved well in some cases - as in a refusal to act against Yeltsin after the abortive coup attempt of 1990 - and not, as in the wars of Chechnya. Moreover, most of the former Soviet republics are remarkable for what hasn't happened - the rise of a military dictator, and in particular a dictator that sees the regional instability as an opportunity for empire building. With the civil infrastructure breaking down, the Western ideal of a civilian-directed military is difficult to achieve. So, too, when the prestige attached to being an officer has dropped, and the spoils available to corrupt men-at-arms risen. The role of military force should not be wholly denigrated, provided the security services can be encouraged to protect the rule of law against both their fellows and the corrupt civilian politicians who exercise nominal control over them. Thus careful steps should be taken when dreaming up solutions to the problem of militias and corrupt militaries. They are sufficiently embedded in the political and civic context, and sufficiently without non-criminal forms of prestige and compensation, that old admonishments about civil-military relations won't work. },

	Annote = {McCarthy argues that the real story of Thatcherism wasn't a confrontation with the elements that were depressing the British state, per se, but in fact a transformation of hte idea of the state away from a ``society'' model towards a more authoritarian model where local communities became dependent on the center. Thus Thatcher attempted to build a particular type of state in Britain, all the while protesting that she sought to return Britain to its more virtuous, and less statist, past. This occurred in a historical environment of Britain as having a weak state. Early industrialization plus early compromises on labor representation and some kinds of welfare meant that Britain did not need state intervention to achieve social stability, in contrast to its Continental counterparts. But this harmony hid the internal decay of the nation - in education, industrial capacity, and so forth - so long as the external conditions - notably empire - remained. Moreover, the old instititutions retained their form - e.g., the House of Lords - long after they'd lost their function, masking how the state had changed beneath society even as society was wedded to an idyll that, if it had ever existed, did so under conditions long gone. The result was a state arrangement that was more alliance than institution - unions, industry, the City, and the Church in precarious tension with one another, each with their own faction to control, each to a large extent unconcerned with the others. It was this arrangement that contributed to Britain's ruin and this arrangement that Thatcher, to a partial extent, at least, would seek to change. Thus the battles to rein in spending of local councils, notably the Greater London Council; the fostering of increased local independence of schools from the national system, which in turn made them more dependent on the centralized funding; the crushing of the unions, with its effects not only on industry but on the Labour Party, also; and the increased authoritarianism of laws that seemed to fly in the face of hallowed British traditions - trial by jury, privacy, and so on. The ability to accomplish this rather radical transformation of Britain was rooted in a cultural crisis - namely, that Britain felt it lagged behind not only its major European counterparts, but also its own potential. The tendency to blame various parts of society - unions, workers, immigrants, Europe etc - set the stage for a divisive leader like Thatcher. But this environment proved less useful for reforming Britain's underlying economic problems at least immediately. Boom was followed immediately by bust. Distance from the EU, based on perhaps faulty notions of parliamentary independence and a technocratic Brussels dictatorship, deprived it of the ability to influence Europe yet again. The decline of industry made the City even more important - with dubious effects for the rest of the country. },

@inbook{Hall1986,
	Annote = {Hall makes an institutionalist argument for the structure of Britain's postwar economy and its difficulties. The institutional structure was largely determined by the historical development pathway experienced by Britain in the 19th c: Early industrialization around small, self-financing businesses with weak relationships to banks. Those banks in turn were relatively small themselves, at least until the late 19th century when they developed an international financial role investing the surplus capital of British industry. But by then, the firm structure had prevented movement into new technologies - like coal and steel - that were capital-intensive, and had delayed recapitalization of old industries. Thus financial institutions had large incentives to invest abroad, and British industry began to lag. Tied to this are other institutions: the craft-union legacy, the independence of the central bank, the weakness of economic regulatory institutions (cf. Gerschenkron and the role of the state). Finally, financing of the two World Wars resulted in a huge Sterling overhang that put the City's fate in the hands of honoring its overseas debts and assets. Thus protecting the value of hte sterling became paramount to both the City and the government, regardless of its damage to the domestic economy. The postwar era saw the cumulative effects of these institutional features come home to roost. Sterling protection made Britain uncompetitive on world markets. Technological lags meant its largest markets were semi-developed nations (for textiles, locomotives, etc), just as Japan and the US began competing in those markets at lower prices. Lack of investment meant that unit productivity of British workers lagged behind that of France and Germany. Weak state economic institutions meant a real Keynesian policy could not be implemented, and in any case would take second place behind that of Sterling protection. Finally, trade union atomization meant that organized labor-capital cooperation to address any of these items was impossible, since within a single factory labor would have many different, and differently represented, interests. None of this is explained by non-institutionalist behaviors; functionalist theories fail to explain why Britain reacted to Sterling failures but not other economic failures; cultural theories explain too little about various attempts to change the course of British policy.},

@book{Seldon2001,
	Annote = {Ch1: New Labour and the new Premiership The author argues that New Labour marks a break not only with Labour's old past - as captured by the trade unions and the obligatory Clause 4 references to nationalisation - but also with Britain's old political past. Blair's political machine continued Thatcher's tradition of campaigning as much against his own party as against the opposition, and consolidated power to No 10 through continued expansion of the policymaking apparatus directly supporting the PM. But he also brought aspects of the continuous campaign cycle to Britain, and took part less in Parliament than any minister in recent memory. As a result, the Blair government represented an continued shift away from the party as the central factor in government (no doubt due to his massive majority, built on a strong party discipline). Key factors in this move: 1. The repeal of clause 4 in 1994-95 2. Brown's rewriting of the economic policy platform in a way that cut out the unions (through a move to neoliberalism). 3. Development of a specific policy function in No 10, including permission from Parliament to establish executive appointments of the PM who had power over the civil service. Ch2: Blair Blair as a person came from outside the normal Labour channels - as opposed to Brown, who was very much a Labourite by nature. He also came from outside the traditions of British parliamentary government. Thus his ``modernization'' program of stripping the Lords of power, introducing some voting reforms in local elections, reforming constitutional measures, and so forth. Blair was among the most inexperienced ministers in history. He had not spent time as a minister in a government prior to becoming prime minister. As a result, much of the governing structure in No 10 was initially slow to develop, and then resembled opposition - style governance. The cabinet has been demoted in importance. But this dependence on an inner circle has left Blair exposed when things have gone awry. Without deep networks inside the party, and having pursued policies considered anathema to some, when he's in trouble, he's often alone. But he's essentially a big ideas man, not a micromanager like Brown. He prefers to put trusted associates in executive positions and give the responsibility, while continuing to lead on image and initiative. Whether this is sustainable is another question. Criticism abounds that Blair is unfocused, and that this lack of focus damages his administration's follow-through on key policy proposals. His record on the whole is mixed. The economy has done well under Brown's stewardship. Blair's work on Kosovo and N. Ireland has been laudatory. But domestic reform has been halting, and sometimes inconsistent. Moreover, despite a massive Labour majority and significant party discipline, he's proven unable to do several major things: move closer to Europe, significantly reform the NHS, privatize some essential services like transit, and so forth. Ch9: Brown Brown is an essentially different figure from Blair. He is a true Labourite. He is cerebral where Blair is photogenic, puritan where Blair is gregarious. His program for the economy radically rewrote the Labour economic platform, moving it away from state socialism and to a new neoliberalism more consistent with Thatcher than anything else. The first term was largely devoted to proving that Labour could run the economy well. As such, he tried to institutionalize sound economic management, through privatizing the BoE and legislating spending controls. The results were positive, with Britain's economy doing substantially better than its Continental counterparts. But Brown also was responsible for Labour's increased love of stealth taxes, whether on fuel or roads or other consumption expenditures. His aversion to raising core taxes made him slow to respond when the stealth taxes started having adverse results, as in the fuel duties that increased substantially with rising oil prices. Finally, Brown is known as a dictator within the Treasury bureaucracy. He takes little advice from the bureaucracy proper, preferring (as Blair does) his inner circle of advisors and wonks. He's also had a rough relationship with both his Permanent Secretaries (of which Lord Turnbull is the most recent and now most famous). Brown also holds rather different policy ideas from Blair. His concern over controlling the economy has made him loathe to get closer to Europe (in this, at least, he has the sympathy of the Treasury). He shares little of Blair's hopes for political gains in Europe, instead worrying about the economic burden of the euro and Brussels on his carefully managed economy. And in his policies (such as the degree of freedom granted to the BoE) he was careful to stay just shy of Brussels' requirements, so that future and conscious decisions would need to be made. },

But it lacked formal rules of operation (nb this is similar to much of British government, for better or worse). The sense of collective decision making and collective information was palpable. However, while it was supreme on major issues, the bureaucracy could and would bypass it on secondary items, even if the Cabinet had expressed interest. 1920: Record-keeping had become institutionalized, suggesting a change from the collegial environment of the 1900 cabinets, when notes were burned after cabinet meetings. The War Cabinet retained power from 1918, but slowly gave it up to the regular Cabinet. Subcommittees expanded their sweep and took on decision-making authority, acting in lieu of the cabinet. But the Cabinet remained at the head of the policy making process. The Cabinet displayed independence from the PM on foreign matters, while the Treasury retook the dominant position in government after ceding it during WWI. 1939: Bureaucratization of the meetings continued. The Cabinet had separated into a War Cabinet and regular Cabinet with the approach of hostilities with Germany. As executive power increased with the war, the Cabinets switched from being principally decision-makers, to decision-ratifiers. Subcommittees became more important as decision-making bodies that submitted decisions for ratification. 1960: The Cabinet under Macmillan had become more conciliatory to the PM but retained major decision-making status. In issues like the British response to the U-2 shootdown to the planning of foreign summits, the cabinet left matters to the discretion of the PM. In home, economic, and colonial affairs, it tended to be much more active, retaining its prime decision-making role. Politics is more visible in its deliberations, with political consequences being discussed prior to decisions being made. 1980: Under Thatcher, the Cabinet lost ground to standing committees and a circle of senior ministers around the PM. Thatcher found the Cabinet overly bureaucratic. Yet key discussions continued to take place in weekly meetings, with separate times reserved for general, foreign, and home affairs. 2000: Blair continued Thatcher's line of diminishing the Cabinet. It continued to meet, but in an increasingly No 10 dominated system. Phases, then: 1. Sole decision-maker (Before WWI) 2. Principle decision-maker (The interwar years) 3. Principle decision-ratifier (Postwar, until Thatcher) 4. Supreme discussion body (Until Blair, with the exception of Major) 5. Personal system (under Blair, and to a certain extent Thatcher) Reasons for change: 1. Increased role for expert opinion empowered subcommittees 2. Increased role for drafting legislation in the late 19th century 3. Increased government role in social/economic questions empowered committees 4. End of British isolation and entry into world politics int eh 20th century empowered Defense 5. Treasury emergent as the dominant ministry 6. Time pressure - decreased the capacity of the Cabinet to debate 7. Media and instant responsiveness meant waiting for Cabinet could not occur 8. Independent leaking by Cabinet ministers eroded the solidarity of the cabinet 9. Departments became more interdependent and so worked together at lower levels 10. Doctrine of collective responsibility of the Cabinet for government decisions diminished. Ch5. Parliament Summary: Parliament has been weakened between 1900 and 2000, by a host of forces: the empowerment of the executive through 2 world wars; the rise of mass media and the erosion of 'representative democracy'; the devolution movements, notably in Scotland and Wales but also in N. Ireland; the changing attitude towards parliamentarians, who are trusted less now than before. Nevertheless, in key moments Parliament retains its old status as the center of political debate for hte country (as in the Iraq war). Notable, however, is the slow pace of modernization. Parliament isn't particularly more efficient now than in 1900, though its members should have more time than ever to consider its work. It still has trouble keeping its hours, and sits more than its predecessors. Ch. 6. The Lords},

The New Right The author argues that the New Right, born in the late 1970s and early 1980s, contains within it a fundamental tension: it believes in a liberal economy and a small but powerful government. But it attempts to govern in a period when achieving a liberal economy requires a government capable of implementing wide-ranging policies, and willing to be authoritarian in the wake of inevitable democratic opposition to its ends (at least initially). Moreover, the New Right tends to favor what old-style liberals never would have: strong, longstanding commitments to military strength and the use of that strength overseas if need be. Thus the gap between the ideal world and the actual world imposes strains within the far right which express themselves in arguments between economic liberals and social conservatives, and between libertarians and authoritarians. (As in the debate over marriage now - libertarians and economic liberals say the state has no business in the family; social conservatives say that the family is a social institution critical to the fabric of a free society and must be strengthened, by government intervention if need be)},

	Address = {London},
	Annote = {Chs 1-6 1. Argument that the real change wrought by Thatcher was in labor relations, and less so in the role of the state in the economy, or in attacking inflation. The role of the state wasn't fundamentally challenged outside of labor policy, and inflation was handled by exchange rates moreso than by policy. Thatcher may have been a Hayekian liberal in theory, but in practice had a keen sense of what was possible and followed it. Moreover, the real benefits to the economy - freeing the economy to take advantage of new technology and productivity enhancers - were more tied to labor policy than to the other factors. Thatcher's policy wasn't miraculous in that sense - it simply opened Britain to the same innovations that had been used in the US and the Continent for a long time. If not a miracle, it was the right policy. The downside, of course, was a real loss in benefits for the poor and a widening of the income gap. But given the choice to grow poorer together, or to have the economy improve in real terms and then figure out what to do about the consequences, the latter is preferable in the author's view. The key to how this was accomplished was the exchange rate. High rates of inflation and wage increases (due to the 1979 Clegg commission's bargain with the unions that ended labor unrest, and the influx of cash due to the oil shock and the north sea oil boom) were not accommodated by exchange rate depreciation. As a result, workers and firms were punished through the exchange rate and the knock-on effects on monetary policy. The firms had to respond with productivity gains and wage moderation, and did so at a rate previously unknown in the UK. This was the real source of the 1980s boom. Other imbalances developed, however: rising spending and relatively easy credit (brought about in part by deregulation of the financial sector) triggered falling savings and a housing market boom; government spending didn't really decline, despite official rhetoric, because the welfare state costs expanded duue to exogenous factors like more expensive technology in the NHS. Furthermore, the failure to join the EMS had little to do with costs and benefits, and much to do with Thatcher personally. It was an ideological veto that, in the long run, may have denied Britain some benefits (though this was written in 1989, before the reunification shock). 2. Thatcher's role as a union-basher was well-known. What about as a capital-basher? Certainly the industrial decline of Britain accellerated precipitously under her reign. The combination of the 1979-81 recession and the exchange rate constraint forced companies to become more productive or fail. In doing so, she forced a great deal of businesses out of business, while encouraging new industries like financial services (where Britain resumed its place atop the world financial system) and tourism. De-nationalisation was another factor. The de-nationalized industries all saw unprecedented productivity increases immediately before their privatization. While the record is mixed (many of these increases represent catching-up to technologies and processes already in use on the Continent, and may not be repeatable), the improvements are there. The picture is thus one of a government which put business in a position of competing or dying out, to which it responded with both successes and failures. It is not an unabiguous pro-business / private sector record: many of the denationalized industries remained de facto monopolies (e.g. Gas, Steel). Deregulation has proceeded apace, but in tension with the tendencies of the EEC in areas like competition, agriculture, and services. Even Thatcher has not been able to fully resist the regulatory urges of Brussels. But other areas have seen improvements in the sponsorship of enterprise: better regulatory and financial frameworks for small business, a refusal to bail out bankrupt businesses. Labor is less well-run. Retraining is more difficult for two reasons: for individuals it is too expensive, and financing options are limited; and for firms, it is too expensive without the ability to command long-term employment. 3. ?The City Thatcher, though by nature sympathetic to private industry, tends to be skeptical of the City and the intricacies of money-making from money. That said, the City exploded under her watch, thanks to the deregulation of the financial services industry and the rise of sophisticated new technologies for international trading. The combination of the two has put London back on top. Also under Thatcher, the deregulation of other financial services markets led to explosions of new forms of investment - notably financing of real estate, which was a subsidiary goal of Thatcher's anyway. But when greeted with scandal, as with the Lloyd's of London insurance problems or the insular closedness of the UK Stock Exchange, the Thatcher government could be quick to act with force. Forms of deregulation: break up the division of labor between brokers and jobbers (wholesalers and retailers) in the stock market; allow secondary ownership of stock market firms, leading to large banks taking a leading role in the LSE; the 1986 ``Big Bang'' FSA deregulation; and changes inside the Bank of England, including the release of the 'cosset' that limited lending and provided one more control on the economy besides fiscal and monetary policy. 4. Trade Unions The key point is that Thatcher's role in breaking the unions was carefully planned in light of the experience of the Heath Government's attempt to reform the unions in 1974. Then, violence had forced Heath from office. But in the 1980s, Thatcher made sure to confront the unions (1) after a major political victory in 1984 and (2) after establishing a centralized police operation capable of confronting union violence. The 1984-85 standoff with the coal miners was therefore contained, and the excesses of Scargill provided grist to the mill of union reform, which in the 2nd major reform act decreased the power of the union heads and made the unions liable for costs from illegal collective action. It also eliminated some of their legal immunity from employers, and made it easier for employers to retain workers after strike actions. But the larger decline in union power owed more to the deindustrialization brought on by the anti-inflationary measures of the government and the anti-competitive effects of the exchange rate. Along the way, unions had to change to maintain their attractiveness to employees, becoming service organizations as well as lobbying fronts. 5. The Conservative Party Enoch Powell argues that the Conservatives have been changed, changed for good, and that such change grew out of a new, more monetarist policy whose rivals were killed off by Heath's prevaricating in 1974. As such, Conservatives are now, irreversibly, more pro-market, anti-regulation, anti-nationalisation, and monetarist than in the last 50 years, and have brought the country along with them. However, he rejects Thatcher's lack of movement along similar lines vis a vis the EEC and the US. The EEC, as he sees it, is inevitably a dirigist state, the US a hegemonic power to which Britain is only a junior partner. He presumes that future Conservative governments, having done good at home, will now turn to confront these policies abroad. 6. The Opposition The standard argument that Thatcher's long run was in part due to her own popularity, and in part due to the disarray of the left after 1979. The end of Keynesianism, the changing fortunes of the welfare state, and the decline of traditional constituencies like the trade unions all put Labour on the defensive. The infighting that has resulted has pitted old-guard Labourites against new reformers. The process may be healthy for Labour but has ruined their chances at the ballot box. Barring significant further reform in Labour's position, they will continue to present an unattractive, or at least disorganized, face to the public, and the Tories will continue to dominate. },

@book{Hoffmann1996,
	Annote = {Hoffmann's two essays concern, first, the moral and ethical dilemmas of humanitarian intervention, and second, the problem of Yugoslavia. On the moral/ethical question, he exposes a paradox: humanitarian intervention is messy, uncertain, plagued by difficulties of judgement, and risks making conflicts worse rather than better. Final solutions to longstanding ethnic conflicts are difficulty; intervening undermines the principle of sovereignty; intervening in all cases is not possible, and so the discrepancy of intervention vs. non-intervention threatens a universal concept of human rights (as in Rwanda vs. Yugoslavia); and promoting self-determination runs the risk of encouraging fragmentation. Nonetheless, he believes we have no choice: if multilateral intervention, with its at least nominal good intent, fails, it opens the field to unilateral intervention less concerned with the good of the subject state and more concerned with the national interests of the intervener. On Yugoslavia, he suggests that the saga of this conflict demonstrates all the problems of humanitarian intervention: negotiation based on impartiality despite fairly obvious facts on the ground about the Serbs; unwillingness to use military force; concern about casualties; division within the regional powers; a repeated pattern of concessions in the hope that this time the parties' behavior would be different. All in pursuit of an ideal of self-determination after the initial ideal of keeping the federation together had failed; all centered around concerns that endorsing the Yugoslav disintegration would encourage other European federations to do likewise (esp. the former Soviet Union). The final resolution, requiring NATO to use force to back the Serbs into a corner, is proof positive of the problems of earlier strategies on the Balkans. Johanson's response is only partially convincing. He rightly points out that Hoffmann's justifications for intervention - namely humanitarian abuses or the endangerment of collective security - are two radically different cases. The latter falls under Article 51 and the collective security clauses, which are less restrictive than the Article VII clauses that apply to UN-endorsed humanitarian intervention. He is right to point out that we need better definitions of humanitarian catastrophe, agreed upon at least nominally, before we go about invoking it - otherwise, it too easily becomes a tool for manipulation. But his faith in the power of international norms and covenants to do this is, if touching, also rather naive. He notes that we might consider ``changing the government'' if certain conditions pertain - without any real consideration of what that means in commitment of lives and treasure from a pool of scarce resources. Moreover, he fails to establish that the problem of humanitarian crisis really invokes a national interest, such that nations may be more encouraged to act. Finally, he ascribes incredible powers of perception to the international community in his desire to head off humanitarian conflict through conflict resolution and peace-building activities like education and development. The record of the international community in both these areas is as depressing as the record in successful humanitarian intervention. And last, his desire that nations should ignore international ideas of sovereignty when other international ideals of human rights are being violated suggests explicitly that human rights violations have severe enough consequences to trump the security-providing aspects of the core rules of sovereignty. I remain unconvinced. (Need to read the last section)},

In the first period, energy intensity fell as productivity rose; in the second, because output rose much faster than rising energy inputs; in the second, intensity was stable as real energy prices moderated their 1920-53 decline; in the third period, energy prices skyrocketed, and productivity fell, as producers substituted labor and capital for energy in the production process.

	Annote = {Kagan's famous argument, later turned into a book, that the US and Europe share different strategic cultures because of their different capacities for force projection. Americans, because of experience and capability, are more likely to see the world as a series of threats to be confronted, with force if necessary. Europeans, having nearly destroyed themselves with force and then rebuilt their nations with careful diplomacy, have rejected force projection and with it the tools necessary to make it happen. Thus there is a very real gap across the Atlantic, one not simply embodied in the the Bush administration's (reciprocated) dislike for the Europeans. Rather, there is philosophical gap, predicated on a capabilities gap, that will be self-reinforcing as time goes on and that could decouple the former allies. Questions: 1. Kagan asserts that the US is more likely to see the world as a series of problems to be solved, because it can solve them. But is that true? What about Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia (where Europe did most of the peacekeeping and rebuilding), and so forth? Is this more illusion than reality? 2. Kagan addresses only tangentially the question of whether the U.S. sees more problems because its hyperpower creates them. This is not blaming the US: rather, it's simply asking whether, because the US continues to emphasize the role of force in the world (whether accurately or not), it generates just the world it expects. Thus Kagan's a bit fuzzy on the causality. Essentially, it's a view of an unchangeably Hobbesian world - not too different from Krauthammer's, albeit with more tolerance for those who live in it. But Hobbes' was a theory of the nation-state, not a theory of global governance. It's not at all obvious that a Hobbesian approach to world affairs in a world of diverse nation states yields peace, given that those who do not elect the Leviathan inevitably chafe under his reins. },

Rather, intervention, like preventative war and other actions, must be justified on the basis of a utilitarian outcome: will benefits of such an action justify the cost (not just to the intervener, who might reap benefits, but to the target state as well). Little consistently makes the point, whether in questions of sovereignty, intervention, war, migration, and other areas of interstate conflict, that there is but a very thin morality to go on. The so-called fundamental human rights are essentially negative: to be safe against things like harm, seizure of property, or restriction on movement. But these are all balanced against the harm that acting within these rights may do to other political communities: immigration, for instance, is widely restricted out of fear of political unrest inside the host country. Ultimately, then, without a universal code or presence of universally accepted law, states are left to make judgement calls. The musings of those who presume an international morality are to be viewed with skepticism. He also separates morality within states from morality between states, and notes that these are not always compatible. A state may do rather horrible things inside its borders, but interstate morality regarding sovereignty will put a very high bar against intervention, because the larger order of the state system depends on sovereignty as a guard against chaos. },

Furthermore, the threat must originate from the intentions of the rogue state, and not merely its internal behavior or its possession of dangerous weapons. This differs from the Administration's policy by focusing not merely on capabilities but intents, a much higher hurdle. Comments: why is economic wellbeing left out or considered less important? How is ``intent'' a higher burden in the court of public opinion? Could not Hussein's funding of PLO suicide bombers be used to suggest he had both capability and intent to support terrorists?

@article{norton2006,
	Abstract = {Wal-Mart's German Retreat The U.S. price-cutting retailer made a series of bad moves and has now sold its stores to the competition. Was a lesson learned? Want to know how not to do business in Germany? Just ask Wal-Mart. After nine years of trying to make a go of it, the Bentonville (Ark.)-based retailer said July 28 that it will sell its 85 stores to German rival Metro. Wal-Mart (WMT) will pay dearly for its about-face, which comes amid declining market share at its Asda stores in Britain and follows its retreat from South Korea two months ago. The company is taking a $1 billion hit to quit the market, while a source familiar with the deal said Metro paid as much as $100 million less for the Wal-Mart stores than the value of the real estate, unsold merchandise, and other physical assets. The retreat is hardly surprising given Wal-Mart's numerous missteps in Germany. Perhaps its most glaring was misjudging the German consumer and business culture. For instance, German Wal-Marts adopted the U.S. custom of bagging groceries, which many German consumers find distasteful because they tend not to like strangers handling their food. OUTNUMBERED. It also imported its U.S.-style company ethic, which includes strongly discouraging interoffice romances. Many employees found the code intrusive. The company also had repeated clashes with unions. ``Wal-Mart was not very humble when they went in,'' says Bryan Roberts, an analyst at Planet Retail, an industry research firm. ``They wanted to impose their own culture.'' Just as important was Wal-Mart's apparent underestimation of the competition and its miscalculation of the market. Wal-Mart may be the king of low prices in the U.S., but it was often undercut in Germany by local rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. One reason for that may have been that Wal-Mart never had enough stores in Germany to effectively compete. Aldi has some 4,000 stores, giving it a big advantage in logistics and advertising. CHANGE OF PLANS. Wal-Mart also spent many years renovating the few stores it did have and adjusting its business model to Germany, though the company declined to say how much it spent. In the end, to work efficiently, Wal-Mart would have had to invest massively to acquire more sites. In the end, it chose to pull out. Wal-Mart, which has 2,700 stores in 14 countries outside the U.S., and global sales of $312 billion last year, says it now plans to concentrate on markets such as Latin America, Asia, and new markets where it can get a higher return. Has the retailer learned from the German fiasco? Analysts expect to see it taking a more arm's length approach to management of international operations in the future and to be increasingly open to working with local partners. That should help Wal-Mart better tailor its stores to local tastes and avoid stocking goods that are common in the U.S., but with little appeal to shoppers outside the U.S. Wal-Mart's not about to beat a retreat on its global ambitions. But its success means it has got to be more careful about how it addresses cultural differences---across the board.$},

	Annote = {Conclusion A US military attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure would be the start of a protracted military confrontation that would probably involve Iraq, Israel and Lebanon as well as the United States and Iran, with the possibility of west Gulf states being involved as well. An attack by Israel, although initially on a smaller scale, would almost certainly escalate to involve the United States, and would also mark the start of a protracted conflict. Although an attack by either state could seriously damage Iran's nuclear development potential, numerous responses would be possible making a protracted and highly unstable conflict virtually certain. Moreover, Iran would be expected to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and engage in a nuclear weapons programme as rapidly as possible. This would lead to further military action against Iran, establishing a highly dangerous cycle of violence. The termination of the Saddam Hussein regime was expected to bring about a free-market client state in Iraq. Instead it has produced a deeply unstable and costly conflict with no end in sight. That may not prevent a US or an Israeli attack on Iran even though it should be expected that the consequences would be substantially greater. What this analysis does conclude is that a military response to the current crisis in relations with Iran is a particularly dangerous option and should not be considered further -- alternative approaches must be sought, however difficult these may be. Essentially, the author concludes that the fallout from Iran could be substantially worse than that from Iraq, drawing the larger Middle East into a conflagration involving states, non-state actors, paramilitary clients, terrorist groups, and outside powers, with significant impacts to both political and economic stability worldwide. This is true whether the attack is carried out by Israel or the US. },

@techreport{SocSec2007a,
	Abstract = {The report's major findings are summarized below. In 2006 At the end of 2006, 49million people were receiving benefits: 34million retired workers and their dependents, 7million survivors of deceased work- ers, and 9million disabled workers and their dependents. During the year an estimated 162million people had earnings covered by Social Security and paid payroll taxes. Total benefits paid in 2006 were $546 billion. Income was $745billion, and assets held in special issue U.S. Treasury securities grew to $2.0trillion. Short-Range Results The OASI and DI Trust Funds, individually and combined, are adequately financed over the next 10 years under the intermediate assumptions. The combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds are projected to increase from $2,048billion at the beginning of 2007, or 345percent of annual expenditures, to $4,210billion at the beginning of 2016, or 407percent of annual expenditures in that year. Combined assets were projected in last year's report to rise to 344percent of annual expenditures at the beginning of 2007, and 407percent at the beginning of 2016. Long-Range Results Under the intermediate assumptions, OASDI cost will increase more rapidly than tax income between about 2010 and 2030, due to the retirement of the large baby-boom generation. After 2030, increases in life expectancy and rel- atively low fertility rates will continue to increase Social Security system costs relative to tax income, but more slowly. Annual cost will exceed tax income starting in 2017 at which time the annual gap will be covered with cash from redemptions of special obligations of the Treasury that make up the trust fund assets, until these assets are exhausted in 2041. Separately, the DI fund is projected to be exhausted in 2026 and the OASI fund in 2042. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is 1.95percent of taxable payroll, 0.06 percentage point smaller than in last year's report. The open group unfunded obligation for OASDI over the 75-year period is $4.7trillion in present value, and is $0.1trillion above the measured level of a year ago. In the absence of any changes in assumptions, methods, and starting values, he unfunded obligation would have risen to $4.8trillion due to the change in the valuation date. The OASDI annual cost rate is projected to increase from 11.21percent of taxable payroll in 2007, to 16.59percent in 2030, and to 18.55 percent in 2081, or to a level that is 5.20percent of taxable payroll more than the pro- jected income rate for 2081. In last year's report the OASDI cost for 2080 was estimated at 18.74percent, or 5.38percent of payroll more than the annual income rate for that year. Expressed in relation to the projected gross domestic product (GDP), OASDI cost is estimated to rise from the current level of 4.3percent of GDP, to 6.2 percent in 2030, and to 6.3 percent in 2081. Conclusion Annual cost will begin to exceed tax income in 2017 for the combined OASDI Trust Funds, which are projected to become exhausted and thus unable to pay scheduled benefits in full on a timely basis in 2041 under the long-range intermediate assumptions. For the trust funds to remain solvent throughout the 75-year projection period, the combined payroll tax rate could be increased during the period in a manner equivalent to an immediate and permanent increase of 1.95percentage points, benefits could be reduced dur- ing the period in a manner equivalent to an immediate and permanent reduc- tion of 13.0percent, general revenue transfers equivalent to $4.7trillion in present value could be made during the period, or some combination of approaches could be adopted. Significantly larger changes would be required to maintain solvency beyond 75 years. The projected trust fund deficits should be addressed in a timely way to allow for a gradual phasing in of the necessary changes and to provide advance notice to workers. Making adjustments sooner will allow them to be spread over more generations. Social Security plays a critical role in the lives of this year's (2007) 50million beneficiaries and 163million covered work- ers and their families. With informed discussion, creative thinking, and timely legislative action, we will work with Congress and others to ensure that Social Security continues to protect future generations.$},

Thus, investment grows faster than the CA - meaning that, in their words, ``only a third of the total growth of investment is funded by the inflow of foreign capital.'' (Test this?) (p13) Causality is the reverse of typical arguments: a productivity shock drove demand for investment to renew plant, leading to a need for foreign capital, leading to a CA deficit.

@article{Winn2003,
	Annote = {Winn argues that we are seeing a disintegration of the post-feudal nation state, owing to the rise of different loyalty and security structures within and between states that look more feudal, and less national / statist, than at any time since Westphalia. Feudalism saw the rise of competing power centers within a single state, thought a king remained at the top. Security and a place in society was guaranteed by association with one of these intra-state power centers. Now, with ethnicity, NGOs, local government, and national government often working at cross purposes in failed states, though nominally all working within the same state, that kind of feudal power relationship has re-emerged. This is also true at a global level. Though there is no nominal head of global governance, there are competiting loyalties at the super-nation-state level: NGOs, the UN, various regional organizations, and so forth, all of which demand loyalty and prescribe some behaviors. Part of this is a response to the perceived homogenization of culture: the emergence of culturally-organized loyalties like Al Qaeda that presume to protect a culture against the encroachment of world culture. One problem with Winn: he assumes that the move towards mass-market culture is predominately Western, and the response predominately Eastern (e.g. Al Qaeda and the Taliban and similar). But what about the local movements in Europe, or populism in the US? These are similar in motivation if not in methods or ends: resistance to the destruction of local traditions in exchange for international ones. },

	Abstract = {The emergence of eight independent states in Central Asia and the Caucasus after the end of the Cold War presented challenges to Turkey, while enlarging its role in the world. The collapse of the Soviet Union removed the century-old Soviet/Russian threat to Turkey's security, while at the same time created a potentially risky power vacuum on Turkey's borders and threats to regional security. In this environment, Turkey is considered an important stabilizing actor because of its strong historical, cultural, ethnic and linguistic bonds with the newly independent states. While Turkey had traditionally avoided involvement in regional politics, it has since been unavoidably drawn into the volatile new politics of the region. After ten years, despite various setbacks, Turkey has become one of the important players in a region where it previously had only a marginal influ- ence and no active involvement. Although economic and political conditions in the region are unlikely to stabilize for some years, it is without doubt that Turkish policymakers will continue with their efforts to create new networks of interdependency between Ankara and the regional capitals. },

@article{Cornell2005,
	Abstract = {America's influence in the South Caucasus has gradually but continuously been on the rise since the independence of the South Caucasian states in 1991. While the United States has become an ever more important actor in the politics of the region, American interests in the South Caucasus have remained in a state of flux. Support for the independence of these states and for their democratisation and integration in Euro-Atlantic structures were initially enunciated as principles of US policy, while Washington identified few crucial national security interests in the region. In the mid-1990s, energy politics grew to become the main driving force of US attention to the region. While the strategic importance of the South Caucasus had been noted, strategic issues did not become a major consideration in the formulation of US policy until September 11, 2001, the events of which made the South Caucasus an important building block of the prosecution of the global war on terrorism. The developments in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia in the past three years indicate that American interests in the South Caucasus will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. The ensuing increased American presence in the South Caucasus is nevertheless likely to confront substantial challenges. },
