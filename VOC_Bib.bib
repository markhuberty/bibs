	Abstract = {For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

	Annote = {Problems: 1. ``Meditteranean'' and ``Continental'' welfare models are bad for economic efficiency regardless whether they deliver more equity; compared to the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic models, they are less useful for modern competition. 2. Failures of the Med and Continental economies to perform are tied to the welfare state; but are often projected onto the European project and thus undercut it even as its completion becomes more important. What are these models: 1. Anglo-Saxon: low rates of social protection designed to handle ``last resort'' cases 2. Nordic: low labor market intervention but high rates of social protection for those who lose their jobs, embedded in a framework that encourages finding of new jobs and worker retraining. 3. Continental: insurance-based pension and unemployment with strong legal protections against job loss 4. Med: High rates of old-age pension spending Problems, contd: 3. Sustainability of Europe, European economies dependent on finding a way to deliver both equity and efficiency. Only hte Nordic model does that. 4. The organization of EU politics makes determining where competence lies for solving the various European economic problems difficult. The EU has not helped itself by confusing this issue. Thus voters tend to blame the EU (and domestic politicians are tempted to encourage them to do so) even when the EU is not at fault. },

@article{Zysman1994,
	Abstract = {Zysman calls this the ``market logic'' - thus in France, concerned about central control, entrepreneurship outside the bounds of state-mediated capital markets was very difficult, and so the 1980s see little development of small firm innovation; or in Japan, protectionism made economies of scale and rapid technological adoption from abroad critical, and so made the firms very fast to innovate and very likely to deploy massive capacity, preparing them for export markets. Questions: 1. Does Zysman still believe (2) in an era of very global supply chains? If it's now possible to source from and sell to almost anywhere, are national trajectories of supply / demand networks as important? 2. If the firm is the unit of innovation, how does national technology policy fit? What about extended R\&D networks? Is it, for instance, the poor university R\&D structure in Germany that leads to a paucity of small firms, or a lack of small firms that results in little commercializable technological innovaiton from German universities?},
	Annote = {Generally, an argument that both patterns of economic growth and technological development are rooted in historic political / economic institutionalism. But Zysman's a little vague on what comes first. Do political goals create institutions that constrain the possibilities for technological improvement (a la Dobbins on the railroads)? Or, with firms already active in the economy, do they create conditions on the ground to which politics responds? Zysman asserts three things: 1. The firm is the unit of technological innovation. That innovation develops path-dependency over time based on which innovations prove successful. Those that are, receive additional investment; those that aren't are quickly rejected. 2. The developing network of firms in an economy further constrains growth pathways by developing a set of supply and demand conditions that shape possibilities for future firm innovation. 3. Both (1) and (2) are rooted in a set of historic political and economic institutions that ultimately shape what the firm is able to do. },
