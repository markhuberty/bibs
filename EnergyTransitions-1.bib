	Annote = {Why? Three theories:
--Natural monopoly. Monopoly is inevitable and competition is destructive (leads to over-building) so  tolerate the monopoly and regulate it
--Collusion (Demsetz, Chicago school): Utilities sought regulation to limit competition and protect monopoly profits.
--Contracting: utilities must invest in capital-intensive goods that are non-transferable. Pipes, etc, can't readily be sold if the utility decides to exit the market. With exit not an option, utilities would under-invest. Regulation and monopoly protection gives them contract certainty so that investment does proceed. (Williamson, etc) Put another way, rights-of-way were irrevocable; cities couldn't easily take them back. So the city sought regulation as a means of enforcing its property rights via contract.

The contracting approach is policy-ambiguous: regulation should occur, but what type is less clear. Thus there are lots of potential solutions.},

1. The prominence of the concessionaire, operating on municipal monopoly and using that as a bridgehead to other industrial or utility devt in the area
2. Lack of standardization. Each entrepreneur of a concession had incentives to choose a system that (1) provided to the local community and (2) maximized personal profit. Contribution to regional grid, etc, not among the priorities.

	Annote = {On the deployment of electricity networks to  Chicago following the 1893 World's Fair and the electrification of the White City

-Insull as major actor
-Constraint: high start-up costs b/c of capital-intensive cost of grid and generators
-Constraint: most power was used at peak load, for evening lighting. This meant that generator capacity had to satisfy peak demand, but was off-line most of the rest of the time. 
-Other industrial, commercial, and residential uses that would amortize the fixed cost over more kwh nonexistant
-Insull's realization: expanding demand in off-peak hours, coupled to a sliding rate structure that would incentivize off-peak use, would allow expansion; expansion would spread the fixed cost over more people, making further expansion cheaper; hence you need the up-front expansion
-Several innovations needed: the demand meter (English); the integrated power grid with centralized generation; a business model that used a sliding rate structure and demand meters to model investment decisions; consolidation of minor providers
-Note that AC made the problem worse, because the economics of AC demanded even greater consolidation of generation
-Integration wtih public transportation was really important - provided a steady source of demand across a wide range of time points; was perhaps asynchronous with peak demand in the evening
-Industrial use slow to take off; worked best with large, belt-driven shops with standardized machinery where the steam engine could be replaced with an electric motor without changing much else; MUCH HIGHER ENERGY EFFICIENCY THAT WAY

Sees 4 stages:
1. Stage one constrained by supply problems of peak-load demand
2. Construction of large-scale systems based on increasing consumption to spread fixed costs
3. Move from municipal to regional systems via the construction of suburbs plugged into electricity networks
4. Industrial adoption of electricity, leading to even greater mechanization and standardization of work routines

Insull played the major role in Chicago for phases 1-3; worked out the new business model necessary for the construction of power grids that could supply energy on a society-scale at reasonable rates. NOTE THAT ELECTRICITY WAS NOT CHEAPER THAN OIL OR COAL AT THE OUTSET; REDUNDANT SOURCES COMMON IN RICH HOMES

	Annote = {Ch 13, Messager, on prevalence of co-gen in Germany vs. France.

Explanation:
-Not about fuel shortages: both Fr and Germany had those
-Core explanation: municipalities played a huge role in parapublic deployment of electrical power in the early 20th c. Municipalities contracted with corporations to provide power, sat on their boards, and cooperated with industrial customers. 
-Three stages to the expansion of municipal heat:
--Communities were already in the business of ensuring adequate supplies of fuel for home heating when WWI broke out. AS energy became scarcer, co-gen offered a way to supply heat energy to residents while getting more out of a given unit of coal.
--Post-WWII, vertical integration of the electrical industry threatened local control. Co-gen offered the possibility of retaining local control by expanding the portfolio of service.
--Post-1958, coal price depression provided a need to support coal prices while doing more with a unit of coal. Co-gen of heat and electricity provided a source of demand while economizing on use.
-In the 1950s, as oil and gas imports became cheap, coal markets needed support to continue. Co-gen produced added demand for coal-fired power. Municipalities already had municipally-oriented power utilities with local networks. Fear of loss of local control to vertically-integrated firms prompted municipalities to add heat generation to the list of tasks that the utility did; then the coal surplus and price depression provided additional reasons for the expansion of co-gen and municipal heat to continue. (p289)
-Under the 1935 energy law ("Energie wirtschaftsgesetz), and the 1935 Regulations of the German Community, the Laender have specific legal rights to administrative powr over hte provision of electricity and gas; but not on heat production.
-Postwar devolution of authority to local levels reinforced the 1935 laws
-Utilities firms called EVU under the 1935 law; broad definition that continues to give municipalities a say in utility provision by public firms, including in investment decisions, etc.
-The Querverbund, joint administrative control of different municipal utilities for water, transport, gas, electricity, heat. Allows cross-subidization of high start-up costs.

NOTE that this is not the case for France, where centralized control took the municipality out of hte game.},

@book{Gourevitch1987,
	Address = {Ithaca},
	Annote = {Gourevitch develops two classifications for understanding how interests coalesce in economies undergoing strain. First set: Possible policy choices 1. Classical liberalism (free trade, open markets, etc) 2. Socialism / Marxism (state ownership, planning, etc) 3. Protectionism, general 4. Demand Stimulus (Keynesian counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy) 5. Mercantilism (favoratism of one or the other industries under the guise of strategic trade theory - as opposed to general protectionism as in (3)) (1) and (2) are opposed; 1 is compatible with 3-5 in various ways and under various circumstances. Second set: Possible ways of analyzing social groups and interests 1. Production profile (what goods are produced by the country's industry, and how do international economic developments impact the price / production / competitiveness of those goods on world markets) 2. Intermediate associations (what political parties / corporatist institutions exist to interpret economic difficulty and translate it into policy? Where is power held between these institutions?) 3. State Structure (What state-level institutions and rules make certain policies possible or impossible? How do they channel policy problems into policy outcomes by privileging certain groups or interests? etc) 4. Economic ideology (Is there a dominant understanding of the economy present in the society or not? As, for example, in Great Britain in the 19th century) 5. The International System (What position does the state occupy in the intl system (a la Gerschenkron) and how does that drive its interests in both domestic and international senses? How do domestic responses to international problems (e.g., are you a naval power or a land power) influence choices of political institutions suitable to those responses (e.g. liberal vs. authoritarian) From here, tries to show that the responses of 19th century economies to the 1873-1896 Depression make sense in light of each point in these frameworks. Britain's liberalism was confirmed by its production profile (first-mover industrializer with strong trade base, and dependent on foreign ag), its intermediate associations (two-party system generally reconciled to free trade; strong banks and export industries sponsoring both parties; weakness of attempts at Populism), its state structure (Banks again, esp BOE), ideology (Liberals and Tories as free traders), and the intl system (Presence of the navy permitted it safe passage for its goods; colonies demanded free trade). Germany's authoritarian protectionism was likewise consistent with its production profile (very efficient but capital-expensive mfg looking for market guarantees; and inefficient agriculture needing protection), its intermediate associations (weak, allowing capture of the state by powerful interests and manipulation of those interests in pursuit of other ends, like national cohesion), its state structure (the concentration of power in the executive), its economic ideology (Listian protectionism) and the international system (late industrializer, few colonies, in need of an army to defend against great powers on both sides). Gourevitch is very careful not to draw sweeping conclusions; he states that his rubric is not comprehensive. But he does note that the reasons states arrive at one of the five general economic policy frameworks he presents, in light of international economic shocks, are dependent on how groups within those states conceive and lobby their interests. Those interests, and their ability to lobby for them, are tightly linked to the five policy areas he discusses. },

@techreport{Delong1997,
	Address = {Berkeley},
	Annote = {Four explanations for why the firm as ``command economy'' wasn't subject to the same fate as the Soviet economy. 1. Parapublic government function, supported by government. Having large corporations around makes the government's life easier. Tax collection, benefits administration, etc all are handled at hte corporation level. Especially in a government-wary state like the US, means that the corporation relieves the pressure on the government to do these things. 2. Industrial evolution Firm size may generate increasing returns to scale. Furthermore, to the extent that those returns reach an inflection point, the market will punish firms that are either not large enough or too large, because their profits will be insufficient to justify their investments (Firm as profit-making organization distinct from firm as productive organization, the former being much more sensitive than the latter) 3. Coordination Where exact coordination of goods is required, and information is imperfect, corporate control allows better management of production than markets. Large corporations will dominate in these areas. See the auto companies (n engines, n bodies, n doors, etc) 4. Corporate governance The USSR planned economy lacked a means of corporate governance that imposed real consequences on individuals who mismanaged firms. The capitalist system of governance has well-developed ways of doing this. Thus managers are given large amounts of discretion but regularly monitored, both internally and by the market, so that they don't abuse that discretion (or simply use it to unsatisfactory ends). Thus the CEO is both employee (of the shareholders) and boss (of the rest of the employees). That said, CEO's aren't removed too often, still get paid a lot, and shareholder democracy appears not to work very well. Nevertheless, peer pressure and sanction are both useful tools even in this circumstance. NOTE: What follow are Brad's comments at the 3/14 Ziegler seminar Starting with Smith, where the market is so incredible but the entrepreneur as a commander of an economy. Market-enabled division of labor is not done; the division of labor is not negotiated on the spot market, but rather dictated by the boss. Thus corporations take on aspects of command economy. Polanyi and Drucker: Polanyi argues that a market society is unstable and unbearable; Drucker saying a market society is unavoidable and unbearable. Command economies problematic: welfare states can redistribute, but the redistributed stuff still used to buy stuff on markets; command socialist economies still needed managers to run firms like market firms. 1.3 million people today work for Wal-Mart, under a distributed command umbrella, and Wal Mart is highly profitable. Thus there must be forces that create large corporations and make them sustainable. Thus economists are confronted with a quandry: why are capitalist command economies (Firms) sustainable and command economies (socialist) don't. So how to explain this? Drucker: efficiency is in the hands of the manager. Command hinges on manager competence. Thus the market in which the corporatino was embedded was a set of restrictions on managerial discretion imposed by the stakeholders: workers, owners, customers, others. Managerial transgression of these restrictions generates rapid responses (strikes, firing of managers, boycotts / flight, etc). Thus there are markets out there that impinge on managers of command firms and impose discipline that didn't exist in socialist command economies. Thus, Galbraith: this is all good and the fences don't matter very much to economic efficiency, and creates professional interests in managers for good management. Thus managers become reproducing within this set of constraints, and good management generates good outcomes. All the various stakeholders are satisfied, can get along doing other things (working, living, enjoying wealth, etc), and managers can do their thing. In contrast, Berle-Means view of the modern corporation as a perversion of private property that puts bad managers at its head. Control by stakeholders had emasculated by FDR, thus supervision of management isn't needed anymore, and so there's no outside threat to managerial discretion. Thus we need to put controlers back into the equation, because other alternatives wouldn't work. Return of control would remove managerial slack. Then Mark Roe: sacrificing the diversifiers (diversification of risk, diversification of portfolios) gives up the ability to build corporations of size and efficiency. Thus we need to reempower the controlers without causing them to immediately channel assets out of hte firm. Thus the apotheosis of financial organization: takeover artist as diversified controllers. Firm shareholdings were generally diversified, but bad management would prompt takeover artists to consolidate the shareholders, fire the mangers, appoint new ones, and restore efficiency. Thus the end of the 1970s. But - takeovers didn't end lavish pay and inefficiency. 1980s saw an explosion of pay of managers. Thus the Jensen counter that the Galbraithian corporation had managers that were too weak, not too powerful. Thus you need to enhance the discretion of top managers, so they wouldn't see each other as peers but as competitors, and that CEOs needed to have major equity at stake in the firm they ran. This would align incentives. But this also didn't work well. So we really don't know how this works, why it varies, etc. No good durable views of CG. New phenomena: growth of Private Equity as a market segment itself - hard to understand unless either the corporation is undermined by modern firms, or in fact this is just a short-run phenomenon. Also source of M\&A energy: how much came from merging as monopoly power; how much is that it's nearly impossible to downsize an enterprise and thus acquisitions allow you to get ahold of cash flow; or perhaps the Galbraithian empire building corporation is still there, given inefficiency of M\&A. Thus we used to have a theory (Galbraith or Drucker) of how corporation command economies were managed, and in whose interest. But the past 30 years teach 2 things: one, corporations as command economies are here to stay; and we don't have much traction in understanding the mechanisms of control and their variation.},

	Abstract = {Access to adequate supplies of fuel was a crucial constraint upon the growth of pre-industrial cities. This article puts forward estimates of London's demand for fuel, principally firewood, in the fourteenth century and considers the ability of its hinterland to meet it. The documented activities of the city's woodmongers conform closely to a theoretical supply zone as defined by transport costs. London obtained its firewood supplies from a relatively restricted area, within which it stimulated specialized commercial production. The use of coal as a fuel in London suggests that the limits of the wood-fuel system were being approached by c. 1300.},

Opportunities for individualistic behavior, including contractual loopholes and horizontal combinations, combined with a collusive objective function that emphasized overall control and stability, allowed the cartel to survive for over two decades without government interference or support.},

@article{Elmes1996,
	Abstract = {In the past three decades the coal-energy system in the United States has undergone significant restructuring in location, technology, and organization. During the 1970s and 1980s the quadrupling of oil prices coupled with changing relations of production, legislative action for environmental protection, and deregulation in coal transportation initiated major reorganizations of the movement of coal from mines to electricity-generating plants. In this paper a three-part analysis examines the corporate and regulatory processes influencing coal flows during restructuring. Part one describes intrastate flows using coal-receipts from power plants. Part two identifies the changing spatial relationships in the coal-energy system between 1972 and 1990 using a dyadic factor analysis of interstate coal flows. Some origin-destination pairs responded rapidly to changes in coal demand. Others lagged behind until coal production or consumption facilities were developed under new financial and regulatory conditions. Drawing on contemporary and traditional perspectives of industrial reorganization, part three interprets the varying geographic responses of the U.S. coal-energy system and links the industry's restructuring to an emerging coordination of decision making between public and private interests in production, distribution, and consumption. Beyond the well-established shift to western coal fields and the rise of utility consumption associated with population growth, the analysis provides evidence of the grafting of increasingly influential national economic and political forces on to local and regional control of coal production and consumption.},

@article{Zysman1994,
	Abstract = {Zysman calls this the ``market logic'' - thus in France, concerned about central control, entrepreneurship outside the bounds of state-mediated capital markets was very difficult, and so the 1980s see little development of small firm innovation; or in Japan, protectionism made economies of scale and rapid technological adoption from abroad critical, and so made the firms very fast to innovate and very likely to deploy massive capacity, preparing them for export markets. Questions: 1. Does Zysman still believe (2) in an era of very global supply chains? If it's now possible to source from and sell to almost anywhere, are national trajectories of supply / demand networks as important? 2. If the firm is the unit of innovation, how does national technology policy fit? What about extended R\&D networks? Is it, for instance, the poor university R\&D structure in Germany that leads to a paucity of small firms, or a lack of small firms that results in little commercializable technological innovaiton from German universities?},
	Annote = {Generally, an argument that both patterns of economic growth and technological development are rooted in historic political / economic institutionalism. But Zysman's a little vague on what comes first. Do political goals create institutions that constrain the possibilities for technological improvement (a la Dobbins on the railroads)? Or, with firms already active in the economy, do they create conditions on the ground to which politics responds? Zysman asserts three things: 1. The firm is the unit of technological innovation. That innovation develops path-dependency over time based on which innovations prove successful. Those that are, receive additional investment; those that aren't are quickly rejected. 2. The developing network of firms in an economy further constrains growth pathways by developing a set of supply and demand conditions that shape possibilities for future firm innovation. 3. Both (1) and (2) are rooted in a set of historic political and economic institutions that ultimately shape what the firm is able to do. },

	Abstract = {To arrest climate change, a transition to a low-carbon economy must take place quite rapidly, within a century at most. Thus, the rate of diffusion of new technologies such as those for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources becomes a central issue. This article explores the reasons for the particularly rapid spread of two such technologies in Germany, wind turbines and solar cells. We trace this diffusion to the nature of the policy instruments employed and to the political process which led to the adoption of these instruments. The analysis demonstrates how the regulatory framework is formed in a `battle over institutions' where the German parliament, informed and supported by an advocacy coalition of growing strength, backed support policies for renewables sourced electricity against often reluctant governments and the opposition from nuclear and coal interests. It also demonstrates that this major political and environmental achievement carries a modest price if we consider total costs to society, i.e. including both subsidies to coal and the negative external economies of coal.},

Experience curves for 75--90% progress ratio are extrapolated with the help of estimated future growth rate for PV installation worldwide and current module price data until year 2060. A kWh PV electricity generation cost has been calculated for coming decades with the help of local market parameters and module prices data from extrapolated experience curve. Two different prices for grid electricity -- wholesale electricity price and end user electricity price -- are separately analyzed. Household electricity consumption profile and PV electricity generation profile for Cologne, Germany, have been analyzed to find out the possibility for PV electricity consumption at the time of its generation. This result is used to calculate the real grid parity year -- which lies somewhere between grid parity years calculated for wholesale electricity price and end user electricity price.},

	Abstract = {It has been a boom time for photovoltaics (PV) in Germany since the country's renewable electricity law was first passed in 2000, and the law's revision in 2004 has added to the PV fever. According to a recent survey by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) Germany is by far the biggest market for photovoltaics (PV) in Europe. Conergy puts the market now at more than Euros 3 billion. Solar thermal energy also continues to play a key role in the German solar market and shows strong growth potential},
	Annote = {Issues at stake:

1. New German solar PV law as of 2000 uses a declining feed-in tariff; viewed favorably by both parties and endorsed by the industry
2. Si supplies are a critical problem; slowed the rate of price decline in 2004-2005 because of the inability to secure sufficient supply to meet demand; solutions appear to have involved greater PV mfg control of the supply chain
3. Industry sees Si-based PV dominating the industry through 2020 or 2030; organic and plastic options will take over eventually, but not presently at the right point to emerge into widespread use
4. Conflict seen between some kind of general feed-in or "green certificate" market for EU-wide harmonization of renewable energy policy, and the German feed-in system. Mfgs prefer the German system; EU 
5. Some evidence that this is turning into export profitability: reduced US activity in the market + increased interest = increased opportunity for foreign firms. Germans see China, Japan (50% market share) as the major threats. },

	Abstract = {Grid-connected photovoltaics experienced increasing attention in Germany in recent years and are expected to face a major boost at the beginning of the new millennium. Highlights like the German 100,000-Roofs-Solar-Programme, PV programmes at schools financed by utilities and governments (e.g. `SONNEonline' by PreussenElektra, `Sonne in der Schule' by BMWi and `Sonne in der Schule' by Bayernwerk) and large centralised installations of MW size (`Neue Messe M{\"u}nchen' by Bayernwerk and `Energiepark Mont-Cenis' by state Nordrhein-Westfalen, Stadtwerke Herne and European Union) count for the potential of grid-connected PV. Today in Germany a typical grid-connected PV installation of 1 kW nominal power produces average annual energy yields of 700 kWh (dependent on location and system components) and shows a high operating availability. The price per kWh from PV installations is still significantly higher than the price for conventional energy, but new funding schemes and cost models (like the large increase of feed-in tariff in Germany due to the Act on Granting Priority to Renewable Energy Sources in 2000) give optimism about the future.},

The overall stock of productive forest in England was sufficient to sustain the population, but the density of London created particular forms of demand that eventually couldn't be satisfied with wood at a cost competitive with Newcastle sea coal. The transport problem, not the supply problem, was the impetus for change.

@techreport{Bogart2008,
	Abstract = {A new database demonstrates that between 1600 and 1830, 
Parliament passed thousands of acts restructuring rights to real and 
equitable estates. These estate acts enabled individuals and families to 
sell, mortgage, lease, exchange, and improve land previously bound by 
landholding and inheritance laws. This essay provides a factual foundation 
for research on this important topic: the law and economics of property 
rights during the period preceding the Industrial Revolution. Tables 
present time-series, cross-sectional, and panel data that should serve as a 
foundation for empirical analysis. Preliminary analysis indicates ways in 
which this new evidence may shape our understanding of British 
economic and social history. },
	Address = {Irvine, CA},
	Annote = {Absolutely fascinating.

Database of Estate Acts from 1600-1830. These corrected and updated the practice of sustaining settlements, which had governed property rights since the early Stuart period. The authors view the purpose of the acts as clarifying and unclogging the system of property rights, to allow more and better transactions involving property to occur. The sustaining settlements themselves had been poorly documented, complicated, complexly administered, and often unclear about how rights to sale, harvest of timber, lease of mining rights, and other modern economic transactions were assigned. The Estate Acts, which were available via appeal to Parliament, clarified these and permitted trade in real estate to occur. 

IN PARTICULAR: see the information on timber rights and mining rights. 

MAY BE USEFUL to get this database, to see what was occurring with rights to coal seams, etc. },

	Abstract = {It has long been the accepted view that twentieth-century British voters tend to base their vote decisions chiefly upon the partisan affiliations of the candidates, rather than upon the candidates' personal policy beliefs or characteristics; voters are 'party-orientated' rather than 'candidate-orientated'. This article focuses upon three previously unanswered questions: (1) when did English voters become party-orientated? (2) why did they do so? and (3) what were the consequences? After demonstrating statistically that English voting behaviour changed markedly during the nineteenth century (based upon an analysis of over a thousand election contests between 1832 and 1918), the causal relationships between electoral choice and Parliamentary behaviour are examined.},
	Annote = {Major points:

1. That after 1832, there was a gradual shift in Britain to party voting rather than member voting by the electorate
2. That a dominant cause of this shift was the change to private bills' rules in Parliament, that put neutral members rather than interested members in charge. This increase in party power over regulation of commerce and construction of public goods (canals, railways, granting of charters, land planning, etc) meant that the electorate had greater incentive to select on the party that represented their interests rather than the member, because members with conflicts of interest no longer could operate as if these did not exist.

NOTE: the private bills issue figures heavily in the construction of the transport infrastructure, and thus with the second half of hte coal transition (when the canals opened up the possibility of inland coal mining). Need to find more about this.},

@article{mokyr2007distributional,
	Annote = {Excellent summary of the literature on the early English industrial revolution.

Three key points:

1. First, during the 18th century, Parliament itself changed radically in its ability to make national policy rather than to support corrupt rent-seeking on the part of Members. See Cox (1986) on this change, which Mokyr suggests occurs after the Glorious Revolution that is given so much credit by North and Weingast. 

2. Then, Parliament, in the process of consolidating power to itself, begins to implement legislation more consistent with a set of internal principles than with private rent-seeking. Note that this does not mean the end of oligopoly, rent seeking, or legislation for private gain; but it does suggest that attempts to protect old industry or patterns of economic activity via legislation increasingly failed (see wool vs. cotton), keeping the door open to industrial change

3. Finally, most of hte gains prior to 1845 or so went to the landed gentry, who benefitted from increased demand for land brought about by new demands on land (mining, textiles (wool), agriculture (after the Acts of Enclosure), and industrial plants). Thus while the early IR in England brought about major systemic changes, gains were concentrated in a few hands. Most of these were in turn members of Parliament. 

Things to check:
-Cox on changing British parliamentary politics
-Blackstone's summary of the laws of England

Econometric (regression) analysis of the effect of the Vend on the price of coal in London; concludes that it raised prices by 6-8%, but that the Crown tax on coal imported to London had much greater effects, apparently to the ignorance of Parliament, which regularly inquired into the cost of coal and how to reduce it. },

	Abstract = {There are two views of the British Industrial Revolution in the literature today. The more traditional description sees the Industrial Revolution as a broad change in the British economy and society. This broad view of the Industrial Revolution has been challenged by Crafts and Harley who see the Industrial Revolution as the result of technical change in only a few industries. This article presents a test of these views using the Ricardian model of international trade with many goods. British trade data are used to implement the test and discriminate between the two views of the Industrial Revolution.},

Analyses of economic change which rely on growth accounting and macroeconomic estimates of productivity indicate continuity with the past; social historians have followed in turning aside from the analysis of new class formations. This article challenges these perspectives. Currently accepted economic indicators and recent social history underplay the extent and uniqueness of economic and social transformation. The article emphasizes change in technology, the use of a female and child labour force, regional specialization, demographic behaviour, and political change.},
